They were based in Kirkland, Washington. The two expand upon The Blood Brothers sound by making more electronic and dance music, while still keeping their hardcore roots. Songs have plenty of breakdowns and other traditional \"Blood Brothers\" sounds. Their first album, Chandeliers in the Savannah, was written completely by Whitney and was his first attempt at songwriting. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Neon+Blonde\">Read more on Last.fm</a>","content":"Neon Blonde was a dance-punk/indie electronica/experimental post-hardcore duo consisting of Johnny Whitney and Mark Gajadhar from The Blood Brothers. They were based in Kirkland, Washington. The two expand upon The Blood Brothers sound by making more electronic and dance music, while still keeping their hardcore roots. Songs have plenty of breakdowns and other traditional \"Blood Brothers\" sounds. Their first album, Chandeliers in the Savannah, was written completely by Whitney and was his first attempt at songwriting. This also gave Whitney the opportunity to showcase his guitar work for the first time. They were signed to Dim Mak Records.\n\nThe band has not toured extensively and during the few shows they played, Neon Blonde used temporary members to fill in for the remaining instruments Gajadhar and Whitney could not play. Neon Blonde was a side project for the two, their focus remained mainly on the Blood Brothers.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Neon+Blonde\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
