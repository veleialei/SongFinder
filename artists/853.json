(Obnoxious, Loud, and Drunk) The Dave Brockie Experience is made up of Dave Brockie (bass and vocals), Brad Roberts (drums), and Mike Derks (guitar). Much like their predecessors, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, this band fully expects to choke to death on their own vomit. But the motivations behind this outfit go much deeper than that. Brockie feels he must attempt to rip-off GWAR's name for money and sex. Roberts enjoys embezzling merchandise funds, while Derks is involved simply to watch Brockie \"make an ass out of himself\". Whether he's drinking shots of his own underwear sweat, or tackling a club's Christmas tree while nude, Brockie is sure to do just that.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Brockie+Experience\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
