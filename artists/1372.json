Born in the parish of Clarendon, Jamaica he is currently a popular artist in reggae music. this has come after many years of recording and waiting in the wings. In 1997, he released his debut album Brother To Brother and, to date, has released 10 albums.\n\nWashington began his musical career in the early seventies as the lead singer for the group Names And Faces. He later became the lead singer in a band called 35 Incorporated and learned to play the drums under the guidance of, then drummer, Joseph Hill. When Hill left the band, Washington filled the slot, and became a singing drummer.\n\nWashington made his first hit record Rockers Not Crackers in 1978 for the Joe Gibbs Record label; but he did not grace the charts again until the release of the hit Kindness For Weakness in 1998.\n\nOver the years, Washington has recorded sporadically as a solo singer and extensively as a studio drummer and has laid tracks for various artists. Simultaneously, Washington was a full-time drummer (sometimes singer) in several different bands, such as: The Avengers, The Titans, and Happiness Unlimited. With Happiness Unlimited he migrated to the USA to work with Stevie Wonder. The other bands he played with are Calabash and bands that backed Artists such as Leroy Sibbles, Shinehead, Junior Reid, Gregory Isaacs, Sister Carol and the Meditations.\n\nFrom the resurgence of Glen Washington’s singing career, his smooth, raspy, bass voice has often been likened to that of Beres Hammond. Washington says, “Beres is one of my favorite entertainers, so I regard it as a compliment to be compared with him.” With the release of over forty singles and eleven albums in four years, Washington has established himself as not only a singer but also as a songwriter, penning his own songs.\n\nOther albums released by Washington are Can’t You See produced by Jah Life Records; Think About It for Philip Smart; Number One Girl produced by Lloyd Campbell & Jason Sterling, Solitary Red Rose for Ruff Stuff; Can’t Keep A Good Man Down for Don One; Wondering Stranger for Coxone Dodd, Reggae Max for Jet Star, Free Up The Vibes for Stingray and Your Love for Lloyd Campbell & Jason Sterling.\n\nWashington said, “As a drummer backing other artists, I have toured the world, playing in countries like Japan, North, South and Central America, all over Europe and all the Caribbean Islands. Now I am repeating those trips as the featured artist, and it’s a great feeling to see thousands of fans coming out for my performances.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Glen+Washington\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
