Being involved with electronic music since 1999, many may recognise him for tracks such as Raindrops, Never Comin Down, and Fall Silently with Christoph Maitland and Veela, being featured in previous versions of the digital audio workstation FL Studio. Among his list of personal works, his production reel also spans a selection of freelance works done for various artist compilations, and local artists such as Freda and Kathy Phillips. His productions also cover a variety of remixes for the likes of Ripley & Jenson, Space Maneuvers and Headstrong, to name but a few.\n\nToby Emerson's discography comprise four albums to date: Exodus, Phuture, Aura and Ambient Dreams, the first three notable for having been the three top-selling albums on the former online music destination Ampcast.com, before the site shut down in 2006.\n\nIn the collaborative workspace, Toby Emerson is also found under the aliases Solid Inc with Tom Day, and The Afterschool Special with Jon-E Industry.
