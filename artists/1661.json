His wide-ranging experiences permeate his songs - as well as an award-winning songwriter, he has been a janitor, a Capitol Hill Congressional press secretary, an associate scout for a major league baseball team, a published poet, a seminary student, a board-certified lawyer.\n\nSince his 1999 debut CD, \"Secret Anniversaries\" (described by one reviewer as a “nearly perfect recording”), each of Talmadge’s recordings has received extraordinary reviews and extensive radio airplay. \"Blissville\", first released in Europe, debuted at No. 2 on the EuroAmericana Chart and reached No. 1 on the Roots Music Report in the U.S. The Americana audience responded, and \"Blissville\" remained on the Americana Chart for three months. Talmadge has also appeared as a showcase artist for some of the best folk festivals in the US. \n\nBorn in Uvalde, Texas, Talmadge grew up in small towns scattered across Texas. These places often appear in his songs, along with distant trains in the night, unread letters lying in weathered mailboxes, and memories of the things we love-and leave-blowing across the vast Texas plains.\n\nA graduate of Duke University, Talmadge won the prestigious Academy of American Poets Award and went on to receive a Master of Fine Arts from the Warren Wilson College MFA Program for Writers in North Carolina. Talmadge is an active member of the U.S. Folk Alliance. \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Talmadge\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
