A nearly impossible to find release (although since has been re-issued in Oct. 2006), Mr. Hood preached power and positivity, with obscure samples from Sesame Street found throughout the album, and saw future Metal-Faced-Villain Zev Love X in a uniquely different light. Two years later Subroc would be killed in a car accident forcing the promising MC, Zev Love X into the underground where he would later emerge as the tortured soul MF DOOM. With Onyx having left the group, controversial artwork by Zev, and Subroc's unfortunate death, the release of their second lp \"Bl_ck B_st_rds\" seemed improbable and was shelved by Elektra fearing negative media coverage due to the recent 'Cop Killer' song by Ice-T's group Body Count. The cover art for the album had sparked worries in Elektra's board room. After years of bootlegs, \"Bl_ck B_st_rds\" finally saw the light of day in 2001 on the Subverse record label. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/KMD\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
