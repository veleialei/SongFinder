They released a self-titled CD under the name Luciana's Wish. In 2000, under the name Tryptich, they released an EP of cover songs called Curio, with vocals by Angela McCluskey.\n\nCantelon wrote vibrant film scores for the two literary adaptations, \"Everything is Illuminated\" and \"The Diving Bell & The Butterfly.\" He was chosen because he had to relearn music after a terrible accident left him with amnesia. He had been a prodigious, promising composer beforehand, and had to learn everything again. His personal history fit with the themes of the films, of searching for one's past. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Cantelon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
