The two singles peaked at #26 and #15 respectively in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nShortly after appearing in a low-budget musical titled Calypso Heat Wave (1957, in which they lip-synched to \"The Banana Boat Song\"), Arkin left the group to pursue acting and was replaced by Clarence Cooper. In 1959, Darling departed to join The Weavers; he was replaced by banjoist/singer Eric Weissberg (later of \"Dueling Banjos\" fame). In 1962, Weissberg's college friend Marshall Brickman joined, making the group a quartet, until Carey departed in late 1963 to pursue a solo career. When Brickman left to join John Phillips in The New Journeymen, Al Dana replaced him. With the decline in popularity of folk music in the wake of the British Invasion, The Tarriers disbanded in 1965.\n\nDuring their career, the group in its various configurations recorded six albums: one for Glory Records, one for United Artists Records, one for Atlantic Records and three for Decca Records (including one in which they backed folksinger Oscar Brand). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Tarriers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
