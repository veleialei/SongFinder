They formed in Bratislava (Ružinov, Slovakia)in May 1993 to combine the spirit of old school Batcave and Deathrock with new musical sounds and patterns.\n\nEurope's most unique deathrock band has always aimed at combining the classic atmosphere of early 80's acts and modern sounds and patterns, to create their own alternative of exciting death- and gothic rock. TLDOJ have been going for more than 14 years now, constantly adjusting their personal preferences, in order to provide the world their individual and breathtaking version of a thing that might be labelled PROGRESSIVE DEATHROCK or something. Mary0 and his compagnions resurrect the straightness, the honesty, and crudeness of old, and transform them from their own perspectives, adding new sounds and various layers of subtexts, criticisms and irony... \n\nPerhaps one of the most unusual European bands with the spirit of early 80's Goth and modern gothic-structures and as a result of such devastating combination something totally new was born far from typical nowadays gothsters. Almost 13 years of history but they can't get enough and sharpening their teeth from year to year. The lyrics are multi-layered, implied sense in almost every phrase, their songs like small revolutions, filled with protest against insincerity, duplicities and indifference of a modern society. Honesty, uncompromisingness, sarcasm and irony gasp your spirit. Live shows are similar to powder warehouse explosion. You never know what would it be. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Last+Days+of+Jesus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
