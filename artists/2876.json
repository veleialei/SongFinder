The band was made up of Clint Baker, Dustin Stroud, Mark Johnson, and Dave Keel.\n\nOn August 6, 2002, the band released their first full-length album entitled Hurry Up and Wait. The first single \"I Feel Fine\" became a quick success and was also featured in the 2002 movie Orange County. Additionally, the song \"Pick Up the Pieces\" was featured on the soundtrack for the video game ATV Offroad Fury 2, and in the movie Extreme Ops.\n\nAfter touring heavily for two years, the band released their second album Stop the World on October 22, 2004. Unfortunately, this would mark the decline of the band. After touring for five years to support their two albums the band began to feel quite \"burned out.\"\n\nIn August 2005, the band agreed to break up. Due to the quiet and sudden breakup of the band, most fans were unaware of the split. However the breakup was confirmed both on their official website and MySpace.\n\nFollowing the break-up, Johnson formed the rock band New Disaster with Keel on drums. New Disaster released their first album mixed by Andy Johns and entitled Last Night Rites in February 2008 and then quickly released their follow up album Automanic in late 2009. Baker is currently working on a project entitled \"Vegas Bomb\", previously named \"Twenty Questions\" previously named \"Clint's Junior Orchestra\". Stroud formed Say Hello to the Angels, and is in the process of recording their debut album.\n\nBaker also had a cameo appearance in the FOX hit TV show House. In addition, Paul Ebersold, the producer for two of the Riddlin' Kids' albums, helped to record the demos tracks for Baker's new project. Some of these songs may be part of the soundtrack for the new movie Weekend Junkies. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Riddlin%27+Kids\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
