According to \"Entertainment Weekly\", Love Jones was the leader of the \"cocktail nation\" groups of the early '90s. These groups, which included \"Combustible Edison\", \"Squirrel Nut Zippers\" and \"[[Big Bad Voodoo Daddy}\" were a reaction to the grunge/alternative wave that swept through America in 1992. Cocktail Nation members celebrated the aesthetics and music of the '50s and early '60s -- lounge jazz, crooning pop, and martinis. Love Jones played any sort of pop music that could fit that label -- pop, blues, R&B, bossa nova, doo wop.\n\nLove Jones started in Louisville, KY in 1990 along with bands like \"Slint and \"Palace Brothers\", showing the diversity of the Louisville music scene. In 1992 Love Jones moved to Los Angeles and took up a Thursday night residency at \"Largo\" for a weekly show that featured guest performers like \"Jon Brion\" and Mark Flanagan, who eventually performed on Love Jones recordings.\n\nIn 1992 Love Jones received a contract with Zoo Entertainment/BMG shortly after releasing a 45 single on Minty Fresh Records. Their first full length record, Here's to the Losers, was released internationally in late 1993; the second album, Powerful Pain Relief, was released in 1995.\n\n1993's Here's to the Losers (co-produced by the band and Rod O'Brien) contains a wide mix of sound, including disco, blaxploitation film soundtracks, samba, soul and funk. Key tracks include \"Central Avenue,\" \"Li'l Black Book,\" \"Custom Van,\" \"Drive-In,\" \"Ohio River\" and \"Fragile\".\n\n1995's Powerful Pain Relief (co-produced by Paul du Gr√©) reveals more of Love Jones' inspiration, including Isaac Hayes, early Chicago, Earth Wind & Fire and Chic. Key tracks include the title track, \"'World of Summer,\" \"You Don't Know Me,\" and \"The Thing,\" the latter a single that was made into a short form video directed by Liz Friedlander.\n\nThey also gained fans across the United States through touring, often in support of alternative rock bands of the day, such as Afghan Whigs and The Presidents of the United States of America.\n\nIn addition to their recording work and live performances, Love Jones appeared in the made-for-TV film Since You've Been Gone starring Teri Hatcher, and the indie French Exit starring Jonathan Silverman. The band also appeared in the film The Sweetest Thing as the wedding band, and the Love Jones signature song \"Paid for Loving\" is featured in the film Swingers and on its accompanying soundtrack album.\n\nThe band continues to perform a few times a year in Los Angeles and Louisville. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Love+Jones\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
