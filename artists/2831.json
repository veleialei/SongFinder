Formed on Long Island in 1996 by ex- Sick of It All  bassist Richie Cipriano, who switched to guitar for the new project, Reach 454 also included vocalist Rene Mata, bassist Dan Martinez, and ex-Day in the Life  drummer John Kamoosi. The band was active on the New York scene, gigging frequently with future heavy rock notables like Papa Roach  and System of a Down and playing festivals like the Warped Tour. Reach 454 finally caught a break when Lava/Atlantic president Jason Flom signed them after a strong performance at a label showcase. The band entered the studio in 2002 with producer Jay Baumgardner (Papa Roach, Drowning Pool), and emerged in summer 2003 with their self-titled debut. The album showcased Reach 454's dynamic melodic shifts and hard-hitting guitars, and was possessed of the stylized, radio-ready burnish favored in the existing n√º metal scene of the early 21st century. \" - Allmusic's Johnny Loftus <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Reach+454\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
