They are known for being one of the early bands in the hardcore punk scene to sing about more personal and comical topics reflective of their own lives.\n\nThey were formed in 1978 by guitarist Frank Navetta (RIP) , bassist Tony Lombardo and drummer Bill Stevenson.  Shortly after forming they enlisted Milo Aukerman and made what started out a surf band into a full fledged punk unit.  The Descendents diverged from their punk peers perhaps because of the Beach Boys influences and sang about topics that touched many young punks' lives like parents, food, girls and being rejected.  \n\nThis band separated due to Milo actually going to college (UCSD), like the title of their album. This and other constraints have made them famous for their long hiatuses, sometimes spanning a decade in length.  The band is now spread out across the country and their future is somewhat uncertain.  Lead singer Milo Aukerman currently resides in Newark, Delaware.  He is a biochemist for the internationally known DuPont Chemical company, which is based out of Delaware. However, whenever the end of the Descendents seems to be approaching, Milo pops up again and the band releases a new record.\n\nThey have released 7 full length albums:\n    * Milo Goes to College (1982)\n    * I Don't Want to Grow Up (1985)\n    * Enjoy! (1986)\n    * All (1987)\n    * Everything Sucks (1996)\n    * Cool To Be You (2004)\n    * Hypercaffium Spazzinate (2016) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Descendents\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
