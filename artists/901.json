Berkeley. Chris W. blew his student loan check on band gear and they began to play.\n\nTheir music didn't go anywhere until the Chrises begged everyone they knew to be in the band with them, until finally, sucker that she was, Jane Pinckard agreed to learn to play the guitar.\n\nIn the fall of 1998 they released their first EP, Secret American Livingroom, which they recorded in Menlo Park with Guy Higbey and loaded with pop hooks and pretty vocals. Luckily it became a favorite of local college DJs and some very nice people. On the strength of this debut, they played Noisepop 1999 with Imperial Teen, and later that year, CMJ in New York.\n\nDealership released their second album, TV Highway to the Stars in 2001 after releasing a 7 inch in 2000. It was their first full length album. Chris W. explained that it led to \"an expanded, collaborative songwriting process and therefore I think the songs sound more interesting. It's been fun to do a longer song than we've done previously---not just longer, but with more involved structures.\" It was described variously as \"crunchy\", \"sweet\", \"catchy\", \"nifty\", and \"an album that's easy to love.\" Also \"soundtracky.\"\n\nMost recently they released Action/Adventure, an electronic-n-rock collection delving into video game arcana and spies in love. A couple of videos have been made for songs on this one, check out \"All the Kids\" or \"Forest.\"\n\nIn late 2005, Dealership was happy to add Jesse Hudson to the band to complete their burning ring of fire. The new quartet is busy recording their fourth album and hopes to be finished it with it before 2006 ends.\n\nMembers of Dealership can be reached for comment, complaint, inquiry, or invitation to an ice cream social via email (dealership -at- gmail -dot- com).
