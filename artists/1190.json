He stated in recent interviews he has been influenced by Sham-Chaurasi, a famous Khayal singing school where Ustad Salamat Ali Khan belongs to. Faiz's voice is well known by its large range and a specially rich tone which reminds Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, the legendary Qawwali singer who has been his revered inspiration and whose compositions he enjoys singing.\n\nIn spite of its youth for a qawwal, Faiz Ali meets a success growing near its listeners.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Faiz+Ali+Faiz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
