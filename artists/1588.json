He was raised in Tillamook, Oregon and Roy, Washington, and moved to San Diego, California at age 17 with his mom. In the summer of 2006, he became engaged to his long time girlfriend Christen Stewart, a model.\n\nHe played Rick Forrester on the CBS soap The Bold and the Beautiful from December 31, 1997 to September 15, 1999. He was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award as Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series in 1999.\n\nJacob played the part of Lucky Spencer on General Hospital for three years from February 25, 2000 until February 10, 2003. In 2002, he won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor and was named \"Sexiest Soap Star\" by People magazine.\n\nEven though he does not appear to be a large guy, he is very muscular and well-toned, having been a wrestler in high school. In an interview some years ago, he admitted that he purposely wore a loose-fitting shirt to his GH audition so he wouldn't look too muscular. He was replacing Jonathan Jackson, who was quite thin.\n\nYoung has played the character of Adam \"J.R.\" Chandler, Jr. on All My Children since October 1, 2003. In 2005, he was again nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award as Outstanding Younger Actor.\n\nHe played \"Hunter\" in the movie \"The Girl Next Door.\" From May through August 20, 2006, he starred in Disney's Beauty and the Beast on Broadway, in the role of Lumiere. \n\nOn September 11, 2001, Artemis Records released Young's self-titled CD.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jacob+Young\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
