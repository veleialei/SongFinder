While serving as a worship pastor in San Diego, he has lived out his beliefs by traveling to over 45 countries with his message in song, and recording over 21 inspirational albums. He has written for and sung at Promise Keepers, and with his music has worked with Youth With a Mission, Operation Mobilization, Open Doors, and Campus Crusade for Christ. Brown has supplied hundreds of musical instruments to missionaries and Christians in Third World countries. His songs have been sung and recorded by artists such as Petra, Pat Boone, the Imperials, Amy Grant, Sandi Patti, and Bruce Carroll.\n\nBrown's music is an example of his service to mankind. In 1981, he appeared on Placido Domingo's album Perhaps Love. He spent most of the '80s traveling with his singing ministry and in August 1989, he conducted the U.S.S.R.'s first publicly promoted Christian music event to an audience of over 15,000. Also in 1989, the Sparrow label released Brown's first album, The Language of Jesus. Sparrow continued to release many of Brown's albums, all favorites, but among the most popular was Somebody's Brother. In 1995, Capitol released The Scott-Wesley Brown Collection, again reflecting Brown's prolific ability to find a variety of expressions for his message. As he moved into the new millennium, Brown continued to build on the momentum he had created during the last two decades. ~ Eleanor Ditzel, All Music Guide <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Scott+Wesley+Brown\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
