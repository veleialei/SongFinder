Brothers Adrian and Derek E. Smith worked separately in music for years and years before finally collaborating. They formed the first version of Click Click in 1982 and recorded the single \"Run Me Down\", a ragged piece of alternative rock, that year through Lung Function Records.\n\nSaid label released the single, recorded in Quest Studios, in a collectible metallic sleeve. Still, the group struggled, and they soon split up to pursue new directions. The brothers continued as a revamped Click Click a few years later, however, as they worked with the new label of Rorschach Testing Product in 1985. Bringing in musician Jon Morris, they released singles \"Sweet Stuff\" and \"Skripglow\", which displayed their mutation into a more darkwave outfit.\n\nTheir first studio album, 1986's 'Party Hate', brought them some underground success. The album's cover displayed a mannequin-like figure being strangled and chocked by the chord of the headphones it wore. Evolving more into pure industrial music, their songs served as a dark reaction to the glamorized new wave pop of the era.\n\nThe Smith brothers augmented themselves with various floating members, including Pete Hosier (who remained with the band throughout their existence after he joined), as time went on. They signed to the label Play It Again Sam in 1987 to record follow-up albums 'Rorschach Testing' and 'Bent Massive'. Those releases found them exploring more cold and grey musical vibes in many songs compared to the black and nihilistic vibes of some previous ones. The brothers Smith bumped Jon Morris for Graham Stronach in 1987; Graham remained with the band until the end of 1989, when it sadly imploded\n\nOver the next two decades, the group's work received some sporadic releases, including 1997's \t\n'Shadowblack' ‎and 2008's 'Lung Function - The Singles'‎. The brothers Smith revived Click Click to underground acclaim in the mid to late 00s, even playing some live shows from 2009 to 2010. Their latest album was 2011's aptly titled 'Skin And Bones, which found the group sounding as brooding and nightmarish as ever.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Click+Click\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
