One EP, one smash hit, airplay around the nation, and of course there is the small matter of an ARIA nomination in their first year in the musical spotlight. \n\nThe challenge now facing Deepface is to back up their initial success with more high quality, consistent musical releases. Their ARIA nominated debut EP Been Good was a runaway hit, far exceeding the expectations of even the group itself; and on the strength of this they returned to the studio to start intensive work on their debut album. The fruits of all the hard work are finally ripe for the picking with the lead single off the album ready for release. \n\nI Want To Live is a slice of pop heaven. Once again featuring the distinctive sultry vocal of Shirley Davis, it is the perfect follow up to Been Good, and the ideal entr√©e to the full-length album to follow a little later in the year. The Deepface team called in dance guru Andy Page to mix the single and ultimately the album. Andy has been internationally recognised for his production work with such heavy hitters as ARIA award winners Infusion and Melbourne act NuBreed. In the UK he has worked with DJ legend Sasha and is currently working on the new Hybrid record. \n\nAs a teaser for the album I Want To Live completely sets the mood. Davis' vocal is so distinctive and appealing while the beats immediately establish a great groove. The whole Deepface team take great pride in polishing every note. There is a swell of support growing for Deepface that is almost impossible not to get swept up in. They have the look, they have the sound, they have the talent, and it would appear now that they also have the consistency to make it big. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Deepface\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
