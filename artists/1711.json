Their aim - to bring a fresh, new & diverse sound to the Asian music scene. The sound - they describe as British Asian music, fused with urban and experimental made for all ages and for everyone to enjoy. The end product - their debut album Culture Shock. Culture Shock, released on the independent Asian Flavaz label, has a little something for everyone with bhangra bangers, R&B anthems, Bollywood vibes and Pakistani Indian Pop, whilst at the same time featuring some amazing vocalists including Sohail Salamat and Bila Sahota. The range on the album is a result of their various musical influences which range from Oasis to Mary J Blige and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.\n\nThe first track to be taken off the album, Akhiyan Udeek Diyan, is jinx’s version of the famous original by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan track and has already been receiving great feedback.\n\nThe current videos which are being heavily rotated on the Asian channels are Akhiyan and the final track on their album, Rang to which Don D lends his vocals and features a heavy bass line and infectious drum beats, not to mention a melodious musical rift throughout.\n\nOther tracks on the album include the contemporary Show You - an R&B number with an Arabic influence, Nachley - a more traditional number with a modern interpretation, Mitrade - simply made to make you want to dance, Shisha Da Lenga (which means Mirrored Dress) - which features bold Punjabi lyrics, Yaad - a more emotional track and Gal Sun - a soulful song of which the lyrics and melody were co-written by Jinx and looks likely to be the next single with a video being shot soon.\n\n4) Jinx is a Swedish gabber-artist\n\n5) Jinx is also is an Amsterdam-based heavy metal band. www.realheavymetal.com\n\n6) Jinx  is a rather unknown Finnish rap artist.\n\n7) The Jinx is a popular Swedish nationalist streetpunk\\oi band with former members of Midgards Soner.\n\n8) Jinx is an indie rock artist from various places in the United States.\n\n9) Jinx is a Finnish duo from the city of Jyväskylä and its members are called Cazeus and CyberCuicca.
