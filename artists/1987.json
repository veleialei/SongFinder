Larytta took a creative path early on, and with their debut album Difficult Fun in 2008, they have become one of the most exciting acts in the country featuring lyrical modern pop with a variety of infectious electronic beats.\n\n \nAfter finishing up at the Lausanne-based art school ECAL, Guy became renowned with his own graphic design company Körner Union, and ,aside from other collaborations, Christian is better known a member of the rock band Honey for Petzi.\n\n \nThe music of Larytta is really hard to describe. They bring together weird electronic beats, African rhythms, catchy melodies, hypnotizing voices, guitar loops, mainstream chorus, keyboards and crazy homemade noises created in Christian's and Guy's laboratory, all resulting in an innovative mixture of modern pop/soul and electro/techno, as well as inspired dashes of African music, hip-hop and R&B.\n\n \nNovember 2005 saw the release of their debut EP, Larytta. This was followed by a second EP, Ya-Ya-Ya in May 2007. This work generated a strong and still growing buzz at a worldwide level and enabled the band to perform with the likes of Jamie Lidell, Justice, DJ Medhi, Cadence Weapon, Lee Van Dowski, Why! and Snax, to name just a few.\n\n \nThey also hit the road and travelled throughout Switzerland with their friends Round Table Knights and Bauchamp in The Money Tour during the winter 2006/2007.\n\n \n\n \nDifficult Fun is their full-length debut and is a definitely refreshing crossover of musical styles which makes Larytta stand out from the others. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Larytta\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
