Special feature: the whole album has been recorded twice on two CDs. One in Swiss-german, the other one in French.\nSo it is possible for almost 90% of Swiss people to understand his lyrics! \nIn 2008, together with writer Guy Krneta and musician Jakob Apfelböck, he released the album \"Winnetou Bühler\". It's a fusion between literature and rap, certainly one of the most innovative albums of (Swiss) Hiphop.\nIn 2009 the album \"III\" was be released, somewhat concluding themes from \"Eis\" and \"2\". In 2012 he released the album \"Me Love\". It was followed in 2013 by \"Greis Anatomy\", which was published solely as download and LP version. Finally, in 2015 he released his probably last and final album \"Hünd i parkierte Outos\" (Swiss-german for \"Dogs in parked cars\"). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Greis\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
