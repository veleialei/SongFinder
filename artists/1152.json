Ranglin toured extensively with the Eric Deans Orchestra, one of the top bands in the Caribbean.\n\nIn 1958, Chris Blackwell recorded a Ranglin single; it was the first Island Records release. Later recordings in the late 1950s and early 1960s are often regarded as important in the early development of ska. In 1964, Ranglin, with Coxsone Dodd and singer Millie recorded \"My Boy Lollipop\", the first Jamaican song to achieve international success.\n\nSome credit Ranglin with the invention of the core style of guitar play (sometimes known as scratching) found in nearly all Ska music.\n\nRanglin has continued recording, often blending jazz with reggae. In 1997, Ranglin was reunited with the Skatalites, for the album Ball of Fire. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ernest+Ranglin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
