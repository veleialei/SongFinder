The two younger brothers, Gummo and Zeppo, did not develop their stage characters to the same extent, and eventually left the act to pursue other careers. Gummo was not in any of the movies; Zeppo appeared only in the first five.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Marx+Brothers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
