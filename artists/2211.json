His style is best described as \"Bayou Soul,\" a mix of funk, blues, R&B, rock, and pop, matched with distinct Southern roots.\n\nMarc is best known for the songs \"Where You Are\" and \"Home.\" Broussard previously released several independent efforts, including 2002's Momentary Setback which spawned the hit \"The Wanderer\", a song about self discovery. A re-worked version of the song appears on Carencro. As of July 2005, \"Home\" was released as a single.\n\nAlthough Broussard is rather unknown, he is characteristically known and critically praised for his strong vocals.  However, he has garnered an uptick in popularity thanks to a snappy tune \"Must Be The Water\" which is featured in television commercials on TNT for the 2008 NBA All-Star game held in New Orleans.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Marc+Broussard\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
