Subsequent musical directors and principal conductors have been Antal Doráti (1975-78), Walter Weller (1980-85), André Previn (1985-92), Vladimir Ashkenazy (1987-94). Yuri Temirkanov was appointed principal conductor in 1992, and Daniele Gatti music director in 1996.\n\nThe orchestra toured the United States in 1950, thus becoming the first British orchestra to visit America since the London Symphony Orchestra in 1912.\n\nAs well as performing works from the classical repertoire, the RPO has recorded a number of film scores, including those for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's The Red Shoes.\n\nAssociated with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra is the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, which is devoted to playing lighter classics. It was formed in 1987.\n\nThey had a single in the summer of 1981 called Hooked On Classics and also another single which was the BBC Grandstand Theme in 1982. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Royal+Philharmonic+Orchestra\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
