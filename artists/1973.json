Ever wondered what equal parts “Country” and “UFO” would create? Look no further than Lacy J. Dalton. \n\nShe’s one of the most instantly recognizable voices in music - the woman People magazine called “Country’s Bonnie Raitt.” From the first time Lacy J. Dalton caught the public’s ear, that soulful delivery, full of texture and grit, was a mainstay of country music. When you sit down to listen to a Lacy J. Dalton album, you find yourself pulled in by the very power and heart in this vocalist, because she’s not merely performing a ten-song set, she’s bringing each and every tune to life. \n\nLacy J. Dalton’s music is a product of her wide-ranging musical tastes. She was born in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, into a family of music lovers. Her father played a variety of stringed instruments, sang and wrote songs. Her mother played guitar and sang harmony, and her sister was a pianist. Lacy’s early influences were the folk and rock sounds of Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. She’s always been a writer and artist who loved music with a message and lyrics that somehow brought a new awareness to the listener. She retains this love of material with a purpose, and her songwriting reflects that appreciation. \n\nHer latest album “The Last Wild Place Anthology” adds another 5 million-hour airplay hits in addition to the songs from her “The Last Wild Place”, the CD that was Lacy’s first move back to her singer-songwriter roots since leaving Nashville, and showcases Lacy’s remarkable voice and writing talents at their finest. The music is heartfelt, acoustic-based, Americana/Folk and ranges from the quiet introspective to the rollicking good time. \n\nLacy is an innovative and creative artist with a great deal of real-life experience and an earthy honesty that is reflected in her work. Her voice: captivating. Her songs: spellbinding. Does that sound corny? Sure it does! But don’t you owe it to yourself to find out what's in store for your \"Welcome to the Last WIld Place\"? \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lacy+J.+Dalton\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
