The band had 2 other Top 10 singles, I Need Your Loving (which was a cover of The Korgis 80s hit Eveybody's Gotta Learn Sometime) and So Pure, as well as numerous other less successful hits. The band continue to tour colleges, Universities and clubs throughout the UK.\n\n2. Underground Atlanta rapper, Baby D (born as David B. on November 5, 1983) was only 16 when his first album, Off Da Chain, was released in 2000 on Big Oomp Records. Two years later his follow up, Lil' Chopper Toy was released to much underground acclaim. A major label bidding war ensued, garnering the young MC a multi-million dollar deal with Epic Records. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Baby+D\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
