Among his hits are\n\n    * \"I Keep Forgettin'\", a duet with his sister Maureen, later sampled in 1994 by Warren G\n    * \"Sweet Freedom\", the theme to the 1986 MGM film Running Scared\n    * \"Take It To Heart\"\n    * \"Yah Mo B There\", a duet with James Ingram which won a 1985 Grammy for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals\n    * \"On My Own\", a 1986 duet with Patti Labelle which reached #1 on the US charts\n\nMcDonald has produced and/or appeared on albums recorded by many other artists, including his singer wife Amy Holland and Grammy winner Christopher Cross.
