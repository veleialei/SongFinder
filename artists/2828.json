Ray currently works with the renowned Comtemporary Classical composer Osvaldo Golijov, performing first and solo trumpet in the critically acclaimed work; \"La Pasion Segun San Marco\".\n\nRay has now established himself as one of the innovators of the international Jazz and Latin music scenes. A multi-talented trumpeter, percussionist, composer, and arranger, he presents Jazz from a refreshingly original and contemporary perspective. His two recordings on the Concord Picante label, his self-titled debut \"Ray Vega\", and \"Boperation\", along with his 1st release on the Palmetto label \"Pa'lante\"have been well received by critics, audiences and musicians alike. Vega's 2nd Palmetto CD \"Squeeze, Squeeze\" has also received critical acclaim including Four Stars in Down Beat Magazine.\n\nVega's latest CD is \"East-West Trumpet Summit\" is a collaboration with Seattle trumpeter Thomas Marriott. The CD was released in the summer of 2010 on Origin Records and has hit number 1 on the Jazzweek national radio Jazz charts during the week of June 21, 2010.\n\nVega grew up immersed in the heart of two vibrant New York City music scenes: Jazz and Salsa. In addition to learning about these two musical styles with some of the great legends, he received his formal training studying trumpet with Sydney Baker, Henry Nowak, Mike Lawrence, Stan Shafran, Laurie Frink, Richard Brezowski and Jerry Gonzalez. He studied Jazz harmony and improvisation with Susan Winder, Bobby Rogovin and Lonnie Hillyer. Vega studied Afro-Caribbean percussion with Luis Bauzo. Vega attended The Long Island University Brooklyn Center and is a graduate of the legendary High School of Music and Art.\n\n*The Ray Vega Latin Jazz Quintet presents fiery Latin Jazz from a Nuyorican perspective.\n*The Ray Vega Quintet presents original and standards and focuses on hard core swinging!!\n*East West Trumpet Summit showcases Vega along with trumpeter Thomas Marriott in a program of hard swinging Jazz!\n\nA much in-demand musician, he has performed with Mongo Santamaria with whom he recorded numerous CD's, Mario Bauza's Afro Cuban Jazz Orchestra, including their first-ever European tour, and Ray Barretto and the New World Spirit. Vega was privileged to record three projects with this landmark group including the Grammy nominated \"Taboo\" and \"Contact\". It was during his time with Barretto that Vega was called upon to join the Tito Puente Latin Jazz Orchestra as lead trumpeter. Vega recorded with Puente's Orchestra many times over including the Grammy winning \"Mambo Birdland\", \"Dancemania '99\" and \"Obra Maestra\".\n\n2.)

The duo were signed by MCA Records and their single \"Heartache the Size of Texas\" peaked at No. 54 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in 1986.[2]\n\nVega was signed to BNA Records as a solo artist in 1996. His debut single, \"Remember When,\" peaked at No. 56 on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. The song was produced by Josh Leo.[3] After the disappointing response to the single, release of Vega's debut album, also titled Remember When, was cancelled; however promotional copies did make it into the marketplace. A second single, \"Even More,\" failed to chart in the United States, although it reached No. 57 on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart in Canada.\n\nVega later made a pop album, 1999's Geography, that was released in Germany by BMG. Dusty Drake cut one of Vega's songs, \"And Then,\" and released it as his debut single in 2002. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Vega\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
