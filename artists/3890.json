Their final album Yellowcard, released on September 30, 2016. \n\nTheir music features a rare contribution to the genre, incorporating the use of a violin. Formed in 1997, the final line up consisted of Ryan Key (vocals, rhythm guitar), Ryan Mendez (lead guitar, vocals), Sean Mackin (violin, vocals), Nathan Young on drums, and Josh Portman on bass.\n  \nYellowcard was formed in 1997 in Jacksonville, Florida, USA after meeting at Douglas Anderson School of the Arts. The band was made up of six members back then: \n\nBen Dobson (1997 - 2000) : vocals, Todd Clarry (1997 - 2001) : guitar, vocals, Sean Mackin (1997 - 2017) : violin, vocals, Warren Cooke (1997 - 2002) : bass, Ben Harper (not the same as Ben Harper) (1997 - 2005) : guitar, Longineu W.

Pete Mosely who had produced and played bass on most of the songs on Ocean Avenue took over on bass.\n\nThe Yellowcard popularity \"skyrocketed\" after this period, with a song from Ocean Avenue, Breathing appearing in the game Burnout 3: Takedown.\n\nLights and Sounds was released in January 2006. The title track, Lights and Sounds, was the first single released off the album. It is also featured on the game Burnout Revenge. How I Go features Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks. \n\nIn 2005 the guitarist Ben Harper left the band. He chose to work with his record label TAKEOVER RECORDS and has signed bands since his departure. He was replaced by Ryan Mendez (formerly of Staring Back) shortly before the Lights & Sounds tour began.\n\nPaper Walls released on July 17th, 2007. Light Up the Sky was the first single released off this album.  The album debuted at No. 13 on the U.S. Billboard 200 selling about 40,000 copies in its first week. After their tour for Paper Walls in 2008, the band went on hiatus for almost 2 years. \n\nWhile touring for Paper Walls, Peter Mosely announced in a MySpace blog message that he would be leaving Yellowcard. . Josh Portman took over on bass until the reformation of Yellowcard in 2010, upon which Sean O'Donnell became the bass player.\n\nYellowcard's official Facebook page announced on August 1, 2010, that the band has reformed and will be working on a new record. When You're Through With Thinking, Say Yes  released on March 22, 2011. On October 24, 2011, the band released an acoustic version of the album.\n\nSean O'Donnell left the band in early 2012, replaced by Josh Portman.\n\nSouthern Air was released on August 14, 2012. It debuted at 10 on the US Billboard top 200, making this their second album to debut in the top 10 and their second-highest debut. The album's first single, Always Summer, was released May 22, 2012. Here I Am Alive was released July 31 as the second single. \n\nAn acoustic version of Ocean Avenue was recorded for the album's tenth anniversary.

On August 19, 2014, the band released the first single, One Bedroom. Lift a Sail released October 7, 2014.
