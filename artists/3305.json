You've probably heard of her before, and you may have even heard the full-range of her indelible vocal skills and unmistakable, impassioned voice on the works of other recording artists and soundtracks. She is perhaps best known for her 1999 Warner Bros. Records debut, the self-titled release Terry Dexter which spawned two singles “Better Than Me” and “Strayed Away”, both of which charted in the top 20 R&B on BILLBOARD and her 2008 critically acclaimed “Listen” release and single “I’m Free” which also charted on BILLBOARD. But Terry's also known as a “singers singer,” and artists like mentor Patti LaBelle( Terry co-wrote the single “Anything” featuring Kanye West and Mary Mary ), Jaheim, Eric Benet (that’s her soaring voice you hear on Benet's remix of the number one hit, “Spend My Life With You”), Jazz great Paul Taylor, the group Black Eye Peas and a solo Will.i.am have all called upon her for guest appearances on their albums. She has also worked with other music greats such as George Duke who has called on her to co write and record for various projects and Wyonna Judd and Michael Mcdonald, who she performed and recorded alongside on the Hurricane Katrina record “Heart of America” also a theme song for Habitat for humanity.\nA multi-talented artist, Terry’s lent her songwriting skills and voice to television, film scores and soundtracks such as “Legally Blonde”, “Rush Hour”, “Bring It On 2”, “Deck The Halls” and “Not Easily Broken” “The L Word”, “Kings and Queens”, and most recently NBC’S “The Playboy Club” a musical TV show in which Terry co-wrote the theme song and was featured on a rendition of “Walk Like A Man” which was a single on the shows soundtrack. She also made her acting debut in the 2003 feature film “Deliver Us From Eva” in which she also performed a goose-bump inducing rendition of “Amazing Grace”.\nBorn and raised in Detroit around the heavy influence of Motown Soul and gospel Terry was also exposed and inspired by another Detroit born sound and that was electronica. She achieved international success with her dance single remix “Better Than Me” which charted at #2 on the Billboard dance chart and “If You Wanna” with Chicago soul/electronic music legend Roy Davis Jr. which also charted. She’s released numerous national/international singles again with Roy Davis Jr. Steve Hurley, Hex Hector, and Kolonik.\nIn 2007 Terry added another untapped talent to her brand by securing the lead role as Tyme Prentice in the musical stage play “Love In The Nick Of Tyme”. This #1 stage play production was written and directed by award winning playwright and film director David E. Talbert. In her first role as an actor Terry played to mostly sold out audiences at major theatres such as The Beacon in New York City and 3 sold out nights at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles. She also filmed a live film version of the production which has been released on DVD and airs repeatedly on national cable television.\nUpcoming in 2012… is the long awaited 3rd solo album which can best be described as an Ode To Motown. Terry will make her return to the R&B/soul music scene grown and in raw form. The first single off this collection and new collaboration with innovative label,Rock Room Recordings is titled, “Sunshine”. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Terry+Dexter\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
