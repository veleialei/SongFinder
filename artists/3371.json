They also have a number of \"Honorary Concretes\" who play on their records.\n\nOne of their songs from their album The Concretes, Say Something New, has been featured on TV advertisements in the United States for Target.\n\nAnother of their songs \"Chico\", has been remixed by Australian electronic artists The Avalanches.\n\nMaria Eriksson is also half the band Heikki, with guitarist Jari Haapalainen. They released their self-titled debut, a mini-cd, in Scandinavia in 2002. The follow-up, Heikki 2, appeared in 2004.\n\nGroup members:\n\nLisa Milberg –  current lead vocalist, drums \nMaria Eriksson – guitar, lead and backup vocals \nMartin Hansson – bass, backup vocals \nUlrik Karlsson – horns, piano, backup vocals \nPer Nyström – organ, backup vocals \nLudvig Rylander – horns, piano and backing vocals \nDaniel Värjö – guitar, mandolin, backup vocals \nVictoria Bergsman - Vocals\n\n\nAn email to fans dated July 25th stated that Victoria has left the band to pursue a solo career. Surely this will change The Concretes sounds markedly, though the integrity that characterises their work is sure to remain whatever decision the band make. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Concretes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
