In 1963, one year after the exile, he was born in Lyons, France.\nJuan Carmona was barely 10 when his father gave him his first guitar. His virtuosity became quickly apparent to professional musicians and it was only a matter of time before he began gathering international acclaim\n\nJuan Carmona soon felt the urge to return to the land of his ancestors, to go back to his roots and to imbibe again at the family spring – Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia – with a personal challenge : to revive recognition of the originality of his art in the town considered as the cradle of flamenco. And the wager was won. For more than eight years he rubbed elbows with and accompanied the greatest names in flamenco, all the while immersing himself in their talents : the singers Agujetas, Duquende, Terremoto Hijo, Capuyo de Jerez, Rubichi, Antonio y Manuel Malenas, Jesus Monje (Camaron de la Isla brother), Jose Mendez… ; the dancers Joaquin Grilo, Maria del Mar Moreno, Ana Parilla, Angelita y Joselito Vargas, Joselito Fernandez.
