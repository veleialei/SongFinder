The participants were fed up with (slow) punk and metal bands and seemed to want to create something \nnew while still playing as fast as they possibly could. Influences frequently named by the band were Slayer, Ruins and minimalist composer Arnold Dreyblatt.\n\nThe three members of the band (often named as the pseudonyms “angel”, “beetle” and “rose”, which are all connected to tattoos) shared a love for philosophy, video games and “flubber” riffs (an own \ninvention, listen to the song “Silver (Bullet) Bible” for references). Asterisk* started their career with an LP (Dogma I) in 2000, then made a split 7” (Dogma II) with Nasum and a split 10” (Dogma III) with Jenny \nPiccolo in early 2001. Asterisk* also appeared on some more or less hilarious compilations during these two years. Live performances however, were very rare and the band never went on tour or played out of the northern region of Sweden. The vinyl releases were all inspired lyrically by specific \nthemes such as the effort of human speech, French philosophy and angels.\n\nIn 2002 the band slipped into hiatus and it is very unclear at this point if the band ever will continue to make music. However, a CD discography of the collected vinyl releases will be released during 2003 by Three one g. A collaboration with Masami Akita (Merzbow) and Lasse Marhaug will also be released by Swedish label Lady Godiva as the final Dogma installation during 2003. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Asterisk%2A\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
