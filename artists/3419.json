Prior to this, two of the brothers toured as a duo known simply as Finbar & Eddie Furey. Their brother Paul Furey had, together with brother George,  Davey Arthur and Brendan Leeson, been in a band called The Buskers. Both bands were part of a successful tour through Germany called the \"Irish Folk Festival\", first in 1974, where they performed as The Furey Brothers and later as The Furey Family. Here they were joined by their father Ted, a famous fiddler, who was 73 at that time.\n\nThe Fureys had their biggest commercial success in 1981 with the release of  the single \"When You Were Sweet Sixteen\", becoming a worldwide hit, reaching #14 on the UK Singles Chart, #1 on the Irish Singles Chart and #9 on the Australian Singles Chart. The single  \"The Green Fields of France\" also gave them an Irish #1, remaining in the single charts for twenty eight weeks. They also had two Top 40 British albums called Golden Days and At the End of the Day.\n\nThe band continue to tour extensively every year. \n\nPaul Furey died of bowel cancer in 2002, with a memorial service also held for his family and friends in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nTheir websites are www.facebook.com/pages/The-Fureys/176527959054822 and www.thefureys.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Fureys\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
