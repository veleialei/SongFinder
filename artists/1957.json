They began to experiment with creating music and together they took elements of the hip-hop electro scene on the East Coast to the West Coast which was the birth of electro-hop and paved the way for artists such as Egyptian Lover and World Class Wreckin Cru. A third member, Miss Rockberry, was later added.\n\nPardee and Wilson formed their own record label, Dream Team Records. Dream Team Records along with Macola Records helped to deliever some of the early West Coast rap records such as the LA Dream Team's The Dream Team Is In The House and Rockberry Jam. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/L.A.+Dream+Team\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
