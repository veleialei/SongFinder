Singer from Switzerland. \n2. Croatian electro/indie/ethno outfit, founded in 1999 in Makarska, Croatia. (Kisha - Croatian for Rain)\n3. Finnish pop group, founded in 2006.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n1. Seeing Kisha in her Hippie outfit with her sun-bleached hair and eyes as green as the sea, you'd think she just came back from a drive through the Californian desert - actually, Kisha comes from Switzerland.\n\nEqually deceptive is her seemingly shy manner when, in fact, she's very self-confident and full of energy.  However, she finds it easier to express her feelings through her singing - \"Music gives me the opportunity to express what I really feel\" - so in her single, 'Why ? (I'm Too Shy)' she recounts a missed opportunity of a few years ago which she vows will never happen again.\n\nKisha's enormous potential was spotted two years ago by Berlin music publisher, Diana Music & Vision while she was working part-time in a packing factory to finance her singing lessons.  Kisha began recording a few songs with the producers of Toneteam and began to develop her own style in the process.  \n\nHer debut single, Why ?, was released in June 1998 and this will be followed by a twelve-track album in the Autumn.  \"I still can't believe this is all happening to me.  I've always had problems opening my mouth and saying exactly what I want but I've finally found the courage to do so,\" Kisha explains enthusiastically, adding, \"To me, making music means living.  Music offers me the chance to conquer my inner conflicts and express how I really feel.\"\n\nIt is fascinating to hear Kisha, whose powerful voice belies her tiny frame.  Guitars, upbeat rhythms and a haunting melody make 'Why ?' a surefire hit and the ideal way to launch Kisha onto the pop stage, where she is destined to win many fans.  Her shyness gives her a unique presence and, unlike so many other pop artists, she radiates authenticity but it is tremendous determination that's going to put her where she's always dreamed of being - and that's at the top.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kisha\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
