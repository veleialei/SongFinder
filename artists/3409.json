The first was a UK underground freakbeat band from the 1960s psychedelic scene. The second, a garage rock band from Boston in the 1980s. In 2006 alternative group The Flies formed in Bristol UK. Their debut album is \"All Too Human\". \n\nThe mid 60s Flies are most well-known for their debut single,”(I’m Not Your) Stepping Stone”, which is a hard rock treatment with plenty of crunching fuzz guitar of a number more associated with the Monkees. They were notorious for their sometimes outrageous live performances, particularly their appearance at the 14-Hour Technicolour Dream psychedelic festival in April 1967 in London, where they arranged to have hundreds of bags of flour explode and cover the audience at the end of their set.\n\nThe Flies from Boston consisted of Nat Freedberg (lead vocal, guitar), Jay Parham (bass, vocals) and Randall Gibson (drums). They had two releases on Homestead Records: Get Wise, from 1984, includes \"All Hung Up,\" which was released as a single (and was later re-made by the Titanics); and Get Burned, a six-song EP released in 1985. They split up sometime around 1987.\n\nThe current group of this name is lead by vocalist Sean Cook, who played bass with Spirtualized for 8 years before forming and fronting his own band Lupine Howl. He also sessioned for Jesus and Mary Chain, Massive Attack and Dr John. During this time he got to know Bob Locke and Tim Norfolk AKA 'The Insects'. The Insects are well known for having worked with Massive Attack on their 'Protection' album (writing 'Karma Coma' and Eurochild). They also worked with other luminaries from the 'Bristol' scene - notably Tricky, Goldfrapp and various members of Portishead (Adrian Utley contributed guitar for our album). The Insects are, however, best known for their soundtracks on TV shows and movies - winning an Emmy award on the way. The original Flies tracks were the result of a few late night recording sessions with no ulterior motive other than having fun ! When people heard the music we were encouraged to continue writing, and it gathered a momentum of its' own. A few years down the track we have our debut album \"All Too Human\".\n\nThe Flies (Spokane) was a punk band that played all through the 1990's. \nReleases:\nVenus Man Trap 7\" (Trench Records)\nTeen Challenge 7\" (Empty Records)\nAlternatoid CD (Very Small Records)\n\nThe Flies were a band from California in the late 60s with frontman Larry Norman\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Flies\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
