Musical director Gabino Garcia approached Edilberto Portillo with the idea early that year and the two went to work auditioning and recruiting members, settling on musicians who had not been in any type of musical group before theirs. It took the ensemble seven months of rehearsal and organization before they began playing for community events and social gatherings. Early recordings generated local hits that became regional hits. Songs like \"Mi Ultimo Contrabanda\" and \"Carga Fina\" caught the ear of audiences outside of Mexico, and the group was soon offered opportunities to travel and perform throughout the States. Beto y Sus Canarios continued to record and tour throughout the '90s. A dozen albums later, they finally made their mark on the recording industry in 2002 with their breakthrough album, Mi Despedida. The record placed on Billboard's Top Latin Albums chart at number 65, with the hit single \"Mi Derrota\" making waves in several Latin categories. With seven major releases since then, including Ardientes and Contigo por Siempre, all of which were met with critical acclaim and hefty sales, the group has remained a strong presence on the charts and the Mexican music scene <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Beto+Y+Sus+Canarios\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
