Rocky would reform the band with fellow Living Sacrifice member and Christian metal legend Lance Garvin (drums) and his brother in-law Chad Moore (vocals). When Rocky and Lance weren't busy with Living Sacrifice, they would hammer away at making material for their death metal side project. The band released an EP (The Fleshless EP), and three albums (For The Incomplete, This Is My Blood, Immune) over a five year span. Soul Embraced's debut album 'For the Incomplete' was re-released in 2003 by the independent label Blood and Ink Records. Since 2003, Rocky has been busy with Evanescence as their drummer and his numerous other bands. Gray said in an interview after the release of 'Immune' that the band planned on releasing two to three more albums and in 2006 announced two new band members: Jack Wiese on guitar and Jeff Bowie on bass, both of which are members along side Rocky in the band Mourningside.\n\nWith Rocky Gray's recent departure with Evanescence, Soul Embraced has been given new life. Soul Embraced has released their third album on Solid State Records: Dead Alive.\n\nNow of 2011 Soul Embraced has parted ways with Solid State Records and plan to release their 5th studio album which will be called Mythos later this year. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Soul+Embraced\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
