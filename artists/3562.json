The Shore are heavily influenced by psychedelic bands like The Byrds, The Beatles, and The Beach Boys as well as Britpop groups Oasis and The Verve.\n\nIn the Spring of 2002, Ashley wrote a series of songs with producer Rick Parker. Parker assembled a group of local musicians, including Kyle Mullarky (bass), Cliff Magreta (guitar), and John Wilmer (drums), to record a series of demos. The demos came to Scott Austin (Maverick A&R Executive) and the band was given a major contract only a few months after their initial recordings. The Shore returned to the studio with Parker to record their first album. The Shore recorded the album over a period of three months. The Shore EP was released on New Year's Day of 2003. Their full length album, The Shore, was released in August of 2004. After touring with guitarist Wayne Faler, he was added as a permanent member of the band in December of 2005. It was about this time that The Shore parted ways with Maverick Records to pursue a better record deal.\n\nLight Years, their second album was released digitally in September 2008. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Shore\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
