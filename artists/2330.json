Tune \"Lover\" is also a fan favorite.\n\nIn fact, \"He Can't Love You\" was the 45th song ever played on MTV. Also notable for having two prominent vocalists in the group, the Michael Stanley Band was such a huge sensation in its home area that it still holds attendance records at Cleveland's Blossom Music Center. They still have a special place in the hearts of many Ohioans after many years.\n\nThe band has had influences across the U.S. Stanley's song \"Let's Get the Show on the Road\" was covered on the 2000 album 'Live in the Classic City' by Widespread Panic. \"My Town\" was covered by Little Texas on their album 'Big Time'. As well, \"Rosewood Bitters\" was covered by rocker Joe Walsh on his 1985 album 'The Confessor'. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Stanley+Band\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
