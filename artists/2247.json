1966.\n\nWith a more obscure career than his sister, Telles has only released a single LP, self-titled, nonetheless widely influential, recorded in 1964 and featuring beautiful and impressive arrangements by Moacir Santos and Astor Silva, as well as arrangements and acoustic guitar playing by Baden Powell.\n\nThe album also marked the first recording of the bossa nova standard and brazilian music classic \"Nanã\", based on a Santos composition called \"Coisa no. 5\" retooled with added lyrics written by Telles.\n\nStill an active performer in Brazil, Mario Telles has appeared as a guest on several recordings but thus far has not added to his recorded legacy as a solo artist.\n\nRev-Ola re-released Telles' lone album on CD under its original title in 2007. Before that, there was a brazilian remastering in the early 1990s, part of Sony's \"Mitos & Músicas\" (Myths and Music) CD series. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mario+Telles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
