Front man, Hakim Green of Channel Live, is an artist, manager, A&R consultant, lecturer, educator and visionary. His group Channel Live, was discovered by the legendary KRS-One and debuted in 1994 with the platinum, Hip Hop anthem \"Mad Izm,\" which was followed with the gold-status album “Station Identification.”\n\nHakim's tree of life in Hip Hop has been a fruitful one. His consulting work with singer Carl Thomas and producer Mike City brought forth the smash hits \"I Wish\" and \"Make it Alright\". He served as A&R consultant for the Carl Thomas’ latest LP \"So Much Better.\" His creativity has also taken shape in visual form with the Nas video \"Got Yourself a Gun.\"\n\nHakim is currently managing artists and is the Director of Artist Relations for the ‘Stop The Violence’ movement recently brought back by KRS-One. ‘Stop The Violence’ is a multi-dimensional movement that has already garnered support of the biggest names in the Hip Hop industry.\n\nChannel Live’s new album, “A Revolution Televised,” features collaborations with artists such as KRS-One, Monie Love and Lord Jamar of Brand Nubian. The album draws attention to imminent social issues with thought provoking lyrics while providing the beat and essence of raw, real Hip Hop. The first single “Hip Hop Nation,” produced by up and coming beat maker Scanz of the 'Rawkus 50' is already buzzing in the underground and promises to be one of the biggest hits of 2008. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Channel+Live\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
