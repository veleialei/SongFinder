However, Butler achieved what eluded many earlier Doo Wop groups during the 1950s and 1960s — longevity. Butler’s solo career had a string of hits, including \"He Will Break Your Heart,\" \"Moon River,\" \"Make It Easy On Yourself,\" \"Let It Be Me\" (the Everly Brothers classic re-done as a duet with Betty Everett), \"Brand New Me,\" \"Ain’t Understanding Mellow,\" (duet with Brenda Lee Eager), and \"Never Gonna Give You Up,\" followed by two hugely successful albums The Iceman Cometh in 1968 and Ice On Ice in 1970. The Iceman Cometh garnered Butler three Grammy nominations.  Jerry Butler further made recordings for Philadelphia International Records in the 80's.  His most noted song for the label was \"Cooling Out\"\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jerry+Butler\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
