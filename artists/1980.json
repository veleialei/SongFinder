The first Languis LP, self-titled (a 9-track instrumental CD), was released in August 1998 and was recorded on a four-track recorder at Languis' studio. Some of the innovative techniques used in the recording of the album include the use of both analog and digital synthesizers, organs, guitars, and samplers. Last Frequency Presets was released in the spring of 1999. It was also recorded in their home studio, and composed using both analog and digital synthesizers, guitars, and vocals. Soft Music was released in February 2000 on 7‚Äù. It contains three instrumental songs that are closely related to sound collage material.\n\nUnithematic, released in November 2000, explores the more melodic pop side of Languis, utilizing more vocals, acoustic guitars, and pianos than before. In contrast with previous releases, these songs are structured and produced with a different purpose. They are treated and understood as conventional songs with a beginning, middle, and an end. Unithematic combines elements from their past releases - the warm melodic synth sounds of Simball Sounds, the precision and complexity of Last Frequency Presets, and the sound collage feel from Soft Music. These elements, combined with gentle but deliberate lyrics, make Unithematic a subtle divergence into a pop based/post-rock song writing world.\n\nThrough the Plug Research label, Languis released a split 10 inch with Safety Scissors, titled Parallel to the Atmospheric Sound of Silence. It is perhaps Languis' most cold and experimental work so far. The whole composition focuses on the relationship that exists between extreme frequencies, and the value that elements such as hiss, noise, peaks, distortion, static, clicks, and pops have as musical elements.\n\n2002's Untied, 2004's The Four Walls, and 2006's Other Desert Cities Ep all continue Languis' foray into experimental/low-fi pop territories. \n\nLanguis have performed live with Mouse on Mars, Kid 606, Blectum From Blechdom, Nobody, dj hoseh, Pulse Programming, Safety Scissors, Sutek, and many others.\n\nLanguis has also been collaborating on projects and compilations with, Phthalo Records, Tigerbeat6, Ubiquity Records, and Zealrecords.\nLanguis releases are available through Forced Exposure. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Languis\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
