They've also released recordings through Sunday Records and the Tremolo Arm Users Club. After Sarah folded in 1995, so did the band. They reformed in 2001, signed to Tremolo, and released a full-length album, two singles, and a maxi-CD (see discography below).\n\nPossibly the band's biggest exposure came when one of their songs, \"Sink or Float,\" was featured on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The song was also included on the UK edition of the series's second soundtrack album, Radio Sunnydale.\n\nAberdeen broke up again in 2005 as their members drifted to other projects. Lead singer Beth Arzy-Dean has also been a a member of Trembling Blue Stars since 2000. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Aberdeen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
