Looking for something that would take away the complacency of the British music scene in late 80's, King Swamp would form. \nAllen and Halliwell spent time in the USA with extended stays in New York and Louisiana in 1987. These stays led to a new vision of rock and roll. Soon they brought on Martyn Barker, another ex-Shrieker, to play drums and Dominic Miller to play guitar. Miller had spent time in the band World Party (and now is with Sting.). To round out the band, they recruited Walter Wray to be their lead singer.\n\nShortly after King Swamp's self-titled album release in May 1989, the press had much to say- Music Week called the album \"a throbbing blast of molten rock from a band with London sass\" ; Sounds noted that the album had  \"startling gravity....towering and volatile, and alive with primal energy\"; and RAW judged it as \"a blistering, caustic rock 'n' roll album.....King Swamp swathe into the jungle with the arrogance and certanty of missionaries\" .\n\nKing Swamp's first single, \"Is This Love?\", reached number 21 on Billboard's Album Rock chart. \nThe band released two albums and nine singles & promo Cds before disbanding in 1991.\n\nWray later produced a solo album with Dominic Miller in 1993, who later went on to play with Sting.\n\nKing Swamp's albums:\n\nKing Swamp - self titled debut album\nreleased in 1989\nTracks:\nIs This Love?\nBlown Away\nMan Behind The Gun\nOriginal Man\nWidders Dump\nYear Zero\nThe Mirror\nMotherlode\nLouisiana Bride\nThe Sacrament\n\nWiseblood - the second album\nreleased in 1990\nTracks:\nWiseblood\nOne Step Over The Line\nFloating World\nWalk The Knife\nCan't Be Satisfied\nNightfall Over Eden\nWalk On Gilded Splinters\nSome Kind Of Love\nKiss The Sun\nWiseblood (original mix)  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/King+Swamp\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
