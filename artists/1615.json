At age sixteen in 1982, she signed a recording contract with A&M, releasing her self-titled debut album Janet Jackson that same year, followed by Dream Street (1984). \n\nIn an effort to establish her own identity apart from her famous family, Jackson teamed up with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in the mid 1980s, creating a superstar-making partnership which has lasted to the present day. Jackson's breakout album, Control (1986), led to the Grammy-winning albums Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989), janet. (1993), The Velvet Rope (1997), All for You (2001), and Grammy-nominated albums Damita Jo (2004) and 20 Y.O. (2006).\n\nIn 1990, with the release of Black Cat from her Rhythm Nation 1814 album, Jackson became the first and only artist in Billboard history to score a #1 hit on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, R&B chart, Dance chart, Adult Contemporary chart, and Rock chart. When \"Black Cat\" hit #1 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock singles chart as well as Billboard's Hot 100, it was the first time a song had hit #1 simultaneously on both of those charts.\n\nTogether Again sold over 700,000 in the UK, making it one of the biggest selling singles ever in the UK by a female artist, and sold an overall total of four million copies.\n\nIn 2004, Jackson ranked as the ninth most successful artist in the history of rock and roll according to Billboard. Jackson also holds the record for the most Billboard Music Awards won by a single artist, a record 33. In 2006, it was announced that Jackson was the \"Most Searched on the Internet\" and the \"Most Searched-for News Item\" in the Guinness Book of World Records. In 2007, she was ranked the seventh richest woman in the entertainment business by Forbes Magazine, amassing a fortune of over $150 million.\n\nIn 2015, Janet Jackson released Unbreakable, her 11th studio album. It was released on 2 October 2015, under her new independent label Rhythm Nation Records. The album also features rappers J. Cole and Missy Elliott. \"No Sleeep\" was released as a lead single on 22 June 2015. It became her 40th entry on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, peaking at No. 63, as well as her most successful entry on Billboard's Adult R&B Songs, peaking at No. 1 for seven weeks.\n\nThe album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, becoming Jackson's seventh album to top the chart in the United States and making Janet Jackson only the third act to achieve No. 1 albums in each of the last four decades. It also peaked within the top 40 of most major music markets. Unbreakable received predominantly positive reviews. Numerous music critics praised the album's diversity of sound and Jackson's vocal technique throughout its production. Reviewers also complimented her willingness to engage in experimental sound rather than conform to contemporary musical trends, as well as the confidence she projects. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Janet+Jackson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
