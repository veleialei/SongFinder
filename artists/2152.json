Her 1975 single \"Caught you in a Lie\" is regarded as the first lovers rock single.\n\nMark was born in Kensal Rise, London in 1960 to Grenaadian immigrant parents, grew up in Shepherds Bush and had her introduction to the music business initially by working as guest vocalist on Dennis Bovell's Sufferer sound system, followed by a residency at the Metro club in Westbourne Park, and via \"Star Search\" talent contest held at the Four Aces club in Dalston, where she won for ten consecutive weeks. Sound-system controller and record producer Lloyd Coxsone provided dub plates for the contestants to sing over at the contest and in late 1974 provided the fifteen-year old Mark with her first recording session, at Gooseberry Studios, where she recorded a cover version of Robert Parker's \"Caught You in a Lie\", on which she was backed by Matumbi, the single also being released in Jamaica by Gussie Clark. \"Caught You in a lie\" is considered the first lovers rock single. It gave her an instant hit with reggae audiences, and was followed by a version of the Beatles'  \"All My Loving\". Her career was interrupted after a dispute with Coxsone and she concentrated on finishing her studies.\n\nAfter leaving school, Mark resumed her musical career working with Trojan Records house producer A&R manager Clement Bushay and songwriter/arranger Joseph \"Tunga\" Charles (of Zabandis), releasing \"Keep it Like It Is\". She stayed with Bushay for further releases on his own Bushays lable including her rendition of Michael Jackson's \"Even Though Your're Gone\", \"Six Sixth Street\", and her debut album Breakout (1981). She was unhappy with the album, feeling that it had been released before it had been properly finished, and did not record again for over a year. Mark returned to the returned to the studio in 1982, recording \"Mum and Dad\" (arranged by Sly & Robbie).\n\nMark was voted Artist of The Year in the 1978 Reggae Awards (UK). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Louisa+Mark\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
