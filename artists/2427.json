Formed in 1989, Moving Cloud is one of the most accomplished and dynamic traditional bands in Ireland today. Among their peers, the individual members of Moving Cloud are highly regarded; all have distinguished credits as soloists, and between them, possess over twenty All-Ireland Championship titles. Moving Cloud's self-titled debut album (Green Linnet, 1994) was selected \"Album of the Year\" by Earle Hitchner in the Irish Echo, citing the \"extraordinarily high quality of playing, brimming with great music and great performances throughout,\" while noted Riverdance composer, Bill Whelan, called the album \"a traditional album of rare grace, subtlety and integrity that also makes a connection with other traditions in a surprising way.\"\n\nMusicians: Paul Brock (accordion), Maeve Donnelly (fiddle), Manus McGuire (fiddle), Kevin Crawford (flute, whistle, bodhrán), Carl Hession (piano). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Moving+Cloud\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
