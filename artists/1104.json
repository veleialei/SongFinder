He was later characterized for several trademarks, such as his yellow-orange hair, his unique low-key voice, or his stage performance, which included excessive jumping and running, or even climbing on stage props and monitors. His acoustic trademark is marked by a light lisp.\n\nThe first international recognition came when Elephant Man and Puma settled a contract for using his single \"All Out\" for their Olympics commercial campaign in 2004.\n\nElephant Man has been widely criticised for his lyrics calling for violence against gay people. In 2003 British LBGT group OutRage! called for the arrest and prosecution of several dancehall stars including Elephant Man, Bounty Killer and Beenie Man for violation of hate crimes statutes [1]\n\nElephant Man also had a song called \"Willie Bounce\" that appeared on several Mixtapes in early 2006. It borrowed the first few bars from I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor.\n\nRecently, the Jamaican star has been signed to New York-based label Bad Boy Entertainment.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Elephant+Man\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
