The Roma are a distinct ethnic minority whose origins began on the Indian subcontinent over one thousand years ago. Why the Roma left India is clouded in uncertainty, yet they entered southeastern Europe in the last quarter of the 13th Century. Because they arrived in Europe from the East, they were thought by the first Europeans to be from Turkey, Nubia or Egypt, or any number of non-European places. They were called, among other things, Egyptians or 'Gyptians, which is where the word \"Gypsy\" comes from. The language spoken by the Roma is called Romani. It is closely related to the Sanskrit from which all modern Indo-Aryan languages are derived.\n\nMost Greek Roma are indigent, living either as nomads seeking seasonal employment, or in makeshift settlements with no infrastructure whatsoever, like the one you may have passed in the Ropa Valley. Living in a legal limbo, Gypsy populations attempting to settle down have repeatedly faced social predjudice and harassment. In recent years, as land has become more expensive, forced and often illegal evictions of Gypsies from long-standing settlements by order of municipal authorities have become more frequent. Their access to the network of social services - such as education, health and social security - is also limited. It is estimated that 80% of Greek Gypsies, most of whom speak the Romani language, are illiterate.\n\nIn the folk musicians world the Gypsies have always occupied a special place. In earlier times it was not customary for the locals to stoop to the profession of the instrument player, thus instrumental music in Greece was essentially in the hands of the itinerant Gypsies. The most famous shawm and drum- players at that time were Gypsies.\nGypsies played the best clarinet as well, and were known for their -good blowing and carelessing manner of playing . Even recently in many parts of Greece, the word gypsy meant instrument-player.\n\n“Instead of saying'- the instruments have come-, people would shout - the Gypsies have arrived !'; So closely bound up with the Gypsies was the profession of popular musician to the Greek mind .Their contribution to Greek popular music was not limited to their passionate playing, how-ever which was said to -strain the leaves of one's heart. As instrument-players, the Gypsies influenced the evolution of an instrumental style, as well as, in certain instances, the structure of folk melody.”\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Greek+Gypsy+Musicians\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
