Well known as both a remixer, music label owner and producer with a hit-making ability and an innovative style, Harris has enjoyed working with many well known and talented people in his 30 year career including Simon Cowell (American Idol), James Brown, Prince, Joyce Sims, Norman Cook (Fatboy Slim), Paul Oakenfold, Tony! Toni! Toné!, War, Arthur Baker, Boyz II Men, Heatwave and many more including several number one hits (Steve \"Silk\" Hurley, Prince, Bass) licensed and released in over 70 countries. Originally a DJ, Harris started selling professional audio equipment in London's Tottenham Court Road, then became a club promoter. In 1983 Harris was invited to become one of the original remixers for Tony Prince's DMC (now the world's largest DJ association). Harris then joined forces with BBC Radio 1 DJ Froggy and was commissioned for many hit remixes for major labels including Polydor (James Brown, Roy Ayers), Chrysalis (Doug E. Fresh), A&M (Jeffrey Osborne), EMI, BMG, Columbia, Island, London and eventually PRT for The Real Thing's 'You to me are everything' remix (UK number three pop hit). In 1986 Harris and Froggy started their own independent label 'Music of Life' with Chris France. The label was initially distributed by Morgan Khan's 'Streetwave' group and the first releases were from Cerrone (Supernature) and Michael Jackson's sister La Toya.\n\nWithin a short time Froggy left to pursue other projects and Music of Life became one of the UK's first rap/hip-hop labels, initially licensing US products, and then with Harris producing many British rap artists including Daddy Freddy, MC Duke, Tenor Fly, Hijack, Demon Boyz (Million Dan), and Einstein who later rapped on the UK top ten hit 'Supermarioland' (Nintendo) (licensed into many European countries and Japan) for Harris's 'Ambassadors of Funk'. With sister label 'Living Beat', there were many projects with artists including Samantha Fox (A Song for Europe), Rolf Harris (BBC TV), Dina Carroll, Jocelyn Brown and Joyce Sims. Also, via Germany's Edel Group, Simon remixed the UK number one pop hit 'The Most Beautiful Girl in the World' by Prince.\n\nHarris has produced many breakbeat albums designed for DJ's and producers, including 'Beats. Breaks and Scratches' in 12 volumes. This was licensed and used by many Grammy Award winning artists including R.E.M. and Luther Vandross. Other artists who produced similar albums for Music of Life include Paul Oakenfold, George Clinton and Norman Cook (Fatboy Slim).\n\nHarris continued to remix and produce many artists. Simon Cowell (American Idol) commissioned him to remix Sinitta's 'Window Shopping' for his Fanfare label, and shortly thereafter Pete Tong (BBC Radio 1) signed Harris as an artist to his Polygram FFRR label. The first release was a rap version of Michael Jackson's Bad (Bad on the Mike). This was followed by 'Bass (how low can you go?)' which achieved US Billboard Dance Number One status and became a pop hit in many countries including the UK where it was a number 11 pop hit with an appearance by Harris on 'Top of the Pops'. FFRR released Harris's 'Bass' album next followed by more singles including Marshall Jefferson's 'I've got your Pleasure control' (with Lonnie Gordon) and 'Here comes that Sound' (a UK top 40 pop hit).\n\nHarris's career has been varied and has included pop video work (Daddy Freddy, Joyce Sims), Radio and TV commercial production (KISS-FM, CD WOW!, Coca-Cola) and several TV documentaries including Run-D.M.C. (Kings of Rap, broadcast on MTV in the US) and REM!X (featuring Frankie Knuckles, David Morales, Jason Nevins, Arthur Baker, Norman Cook, Paul Oakenfold and more).\n\nHis latest project is a return to dance music production with a new state-of-the-art studio and is working on new projects with Simply Music (UK), Deep Haven Music (New York/Miami) including new remixes of 'Bass' and with NY rapper Roxanne Shanté.\n\nRemixes & Edits:\n\nTony Tony Tone – Baby Doll\nThe Real Thing – You to me are Everything\nJames Brown – The Froggy Mix\nPrince – Beautiful (UK pop no1)\nDoug E Fresh - The Show\nSinitta - Window Shopping (Fanfare / Simon Cowell)\nSteve Silk Hurley – Jack Your Body (UK pop no1)\nChicago Trax House Megamix\nThe Stone Roses – I am the Resurrection\nJoyce Sims – Come into my Life\nEPMD – Because I’m Housin’\nBoys II Men – Motownphilly\nWar – Me & Baby Brother / Galaxy\nCriminal Element Orchestra – Opera House\nJackson Sisters – I believe in Miracles\nMcFadden & Whitehead – Ain’t no Stoppin us Now\nHeatwave – Boogie Nights\nTag Team – Whoomp (there is is)\n\nProductions\n\nSimon Harris - Bad on the Mike\nSimon Harris – Bass (how low can you go?)\n(UK pop No11 / Billboard Dance No1)\nAmbassadors of Funk – Supermarioland (UK pop no6)\nSimon Harris – Here Comes that Sound (UK pop no35)\nDemon Boyz – Album (Music of Life)\nM.C Duke – I’m Riffin (Music of Life)\nDaddy Freddy – Ragga House (Music of Life)\nAsher D & Daddy Freddy – Ragamuffin Hip-Hop (Music of Life)\nBeats Breaks & Scratches – 12 Volumes (Music of Life)\nBass! – album (London/FFRR)\nCJ Macintosh/Einstein – The Tables are Turning (Music of Life)\nHijack – Style Wars (Music of Life)\nHard as Hell (Music of Life)\nSimon Harris & Dina Carrol – Don’t Stop the Music\nSimon Harris & Lonnie Gordon – Pleasure Control\nSimon Harris – Turn up the Sound\nBack in Black – I’m the Rapper\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Simon+Harris\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
