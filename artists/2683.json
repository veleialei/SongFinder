Formerly a duo, they are now a quartet of Zach Keener,Melissa L Ryan,Denniz Polk & Halston Luna.\nhttp://peloton.bandcamp.com/\n\n2. Peloton is an indie pop/rock band based in San Francisco, California. Its members come from diverse backgrounds with distant roots in Japan, Texas, and Detroit. Their unique blend of influences and origin is instantaneously evident in the music they create.\n\nSongwriting duties are split between keyboardist/vocalist, Miyako Ueki, and guitarist/vocalist, Brian Jackson. They began working on music together in the spring of 2003. After completing a home demo, they set out to form a proper band. Dustin Robinson, a childhood friend of Brian’s from Texas was recruited on drums and backing vocals. William Taylor was brought in on bass and Peloton was ready to take their first steps.\n\nThe band spent the better part of 2005 writing, rehearsing, and recording their self-titled EP. The group’s debut release serves the listener well-written melodic songs ranging from lush space rock to traditional upbeat pop, to more plaintive, head-on-the-bar numbers.\n\nIn October of 2005, Peloton played their first ever live show at the historic Fillmore West. Since then, the band has been playing shows in San Francisco as well as promoting their EP online, in record shops, and at their infectious live performances.\n\nOn songs like Blue Field, the band creates visions of luscious Japanese hillsides as viewed from a bullet train. Their fuzz-washed, sun-scorched track “We Could Be” best sums up the bands intent in its opening line, “We could be melancholy or we could be the right stuff.” Peloton moves forward and the music world will want to follow close behind.\n\n3.  The german house producer Peloton has released several Netlabel EPs on Corporate Identity. See http://www.myspace.com/pelotonmusik. \n\n4. Peloton (plotô) s.m. l. a group or team working in cooperation to acquire a desired result.\nPeloton (plotô) s.m. l. Scandinavian jazz quintet, formed in 2005. Released in 2007 the album “Selected Recordings”, which provided several remarkable instances of unconventional collective playing, though their music remained accessible to a large audience. Discarding the tradition jazz roles of soloists and accompanists, the players took the lead by turn and created textures that were continuously changing.\nDid intensive touring all over Scandinavia in 2008-2009, by the end of 2010 they were playing at the major festivals all over Europe. By 2016, the band struggled with inner conflicts which broke the surface with the legendary catastrophic concert at The Royal Albert Hall. It was then impossible to continue, and they did not play together until the also catastrophic Live Aid concert in 2018.\nPeloton (plotô) s.m. l. means fearless in Finnish. \n\n(from http://www.pelotonmusic.com)\n\n5. Peloton were an indiepop band from Sheffield, UK from the early 00s. Members of Peloton went on to form The Scarlet Tuesday. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Peloton\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
