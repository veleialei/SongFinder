The combination makes for a quixotic, driving and emotive sound that has been drawing raves from the local Cleveland music scene and beyond. While comparison to Guided By Voices may reflect geographical prejudice, to invoke the names of bands like Spoon and even Superchunk when describing Coffinberry’s stylistically mature and musically rich sound fails to do them justice. Coffinberry executes a sonic authority that permeates their music with untold depth and unrealized passions.\n\nComprised of brothers Nicholas (Guitars/Vocals) and Anthony Cross (Drums/Vocals), Patrick O’Connor (Bass) and Tony Janicek (Guitar), the band hails from Lakewood, Ohio. With proximity to Cleveland’s historic rock ‘n’ roll roadhouse gene pool, the band’s considerable song writing talent combined with a string of lauded appearances with bands like Futureheads and The Constantines have placed them in the firmament of Cleveland-area up and coming bands. Online ‘zine Utter Trash touched on the difficulty of their characterization: “It wasn’t Newer Wave, and it certainly wasn’t Rockabilly. It was…well, Rock and Roll by a bunch of young twenty-something upstarts, naturally. It was short, it was loud, and it was melodic, with just the right splash of dissonance and feedback splattered about like a fun Jackson Pollack print.’  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Coffinberry\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
