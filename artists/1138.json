The group has released twelve studio albums as well as five live albums as of 2014, and they're perhaps best known for their hit singles \"Fly High Michelle\" and \"New Thing\" from their self-titled debut album, tracks that remain classic rock favorites. Despite becoming popular during the glam metal movement of the 80s, the band has little in common with many of those artists and has continued to record and tour since its formation, with the group being notable for its internal songwriting (influenced by classic pop such as The Beatles).\n\nComing out the gate with 1989's 'Enuff Z'nuff', the group received critical praise, with Allmusic saying that the band \"deserves more respect than they'll probably ever receive.\" The album hit the #74 slot on the Billboard 200 top albums chart, with \"Fly High Michelle\" and \"New Thing\" both being top 40 hits on the Mainstream Rock chart. Sadly, though musically being inspired by bands such as Cheap Trick, Enuff Z'nuff's record label decided to present them in garish, tie-die outfits and foster a related glam image that the group resented. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Enuff+Z%27Nuff\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
