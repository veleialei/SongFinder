A mathcore band from Perth, Western Australia, a midwest power pop /rock act formed in the late 70's, and a more recent shortlived New Jersey based pop punk act.\n\n1) Perth's Off Broadway combine a large array of influences to create a feedback filled chaotic sound similar to bands such as The Chariot and the Dillinger Escape Plan. They've supported several heavyweight local acts, including Statues, Saviour, Afraid of Heights, Mom Dad & The Kids,  Against the Tide, No Regrets, as well as For All Eternity from NSW. They recent released their new EP, available for download from their facebook page here, http://www.facebook.com/pages/Off-Broadway/151816348201300\n\n2) In 1979, Off Broadway (U.S.A.), a band born out of Chicago, released its first album \"ON\", including the hit singles \"Stay in Time\" and \"Full Moon Turn Your Head Around\".  The critically acclamied debut album sold nearly 300,000 copies in hometown Chicago alone, however, in other parts of the world, marketing efforts were, to put it kindly, less aggressive. They released the second album \"Quick Turns\" in 1980 and soon faded away until returning in 1997 with \"Fallin' In\". The band's last performance is scheduled for December 18, 2009.\n\n2) The most recent Off Broadway are from New Jersey and make use of a unique sound mixing Rock with Pop Punk to create catchy and lyrically interesting music. Songs such as \"Relief\" and \"Take it Slow\" have been very popular amongst their ever-increasing fan base. Off Broadway has performed many shows across the East coast. Off Broadway sounds most like The Get Up Kids ,Saves The Day, Weezer, etc..who broke up in early 2008.\n\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Off+Broadway\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
