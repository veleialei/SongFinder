A conduit to the past and a bridge to the future, his music -- like his father's -- sounds timeless: reggae that embraces the world.\"\n\n2004 he started the 27-city Bob Marley Roots, Rock, Reggae Festival tour with his four brothers and sons of Bob  –  Ziggy, Julian, Damian and Ky-Mani –  each of whom have their own professional recording careers. The tour was the first time the brothers have officially performed together on stage.\n\nEvery February in Miami, Marley and his brothers perform at his family's annual Caribbean Festival in honour of their late father Bob Marley.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stephen+Marley\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
