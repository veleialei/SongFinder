For the lovers of Max Richter, Eluvium, Rafael Anton Irisarri, and Zbigniew Preisner, I highly recommended this gem!\" About Piano Textures. by Headphone Commute\nTextura.org Had a listener's only exposure to Bruno Sanfilippo come about through hearing his recent Hypnos recording Urbs, said listener would have identified him as an exceptionally refined sound-sculptor working in the electro-acoustic ambient field. But the classically trained Sanfilippo also issues minimalist piano recordings, of which Piano Textures 3 is a particularly impressive example; it's of course the third in a series (the first issued in 2007 and the second 2009), which can be purchased separately or in a lavish box set as a complete collection\n\nPingThings\nSanfilippo's talent and mastery of the genre are on clear display with this release and I have no doubt that I will have to find room in my CD player for another one of his releases that I'll be playing all year long. Piano Textures 2 is a stunning collection of music that I whole heartedly recommend to existing fans of Sanfilippo's work and to those who are looking for carefully crafted organic ambience. Another great release from one of my favorite artists! \n \nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/brunosanfilippo.music\nTwitter  \nOfficial website: www.bruno-sanfilippo.com \n2000\n Instagram \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bruno+Sanfilippo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
