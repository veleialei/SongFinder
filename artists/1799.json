Enriquez was also a background singer to the single \"When You Believe\", a duet by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey.\n\nAt the age of eleven, she participated in the US TV show Star Search and won eleven performances, after which her mother started sending out videotapes of her performances, hoping to score her a record deal. She got a solo deal with LaFace Records, and in 2000, released her album titled Joy Enriquez, including first single \"Tell Me How you Feel\". In the US, Joy's album was released one week after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nOn April 4, 2004 Joy married her producer Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins. Her sophomore album, Atmosphere of Heaven, was released on March 7, 2006 on the independent label Joyful Child formed by Rodney Jerkins and Joy and features the single \"Get To Know Him\", which, like, the rest of the album, marks a change in direction to a contemporary Christian sound.\n\n[edit] Singles\n\nFrom Anna & The King (Soundtrack):\n\n    * \"How Can I Not Love You\"\n\nFrom Joy Enriquez:\n\n    * \"Tell Me How You Feel\"\n    * \"Shake Up The Party\"\n    * \"What Do You Want\"\n\nFrom Atmosphere Of Heaven:\n\n    * \"Get To Know Him\"\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Joy+Enriquez\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
