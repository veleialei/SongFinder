The Goons currently consists of DJ Illegal, Det Gunner, Sicknature, & J.S. Kuster. \n\nThe Snowgoons started in 1999, when longtime hip-hop fans Det and DJ Illegal teamed up in order to make beats together. In 2006, the duo, whose sound is often compared to the Wu-Tang Clan, added Torben and DJ Waxwork to their lineup, and after being signed to New York-based Babygrande Records, the Snowgoons debut album, German Lager, which featured rhymes from MCs like Celph Titled, Sean Price, Jus Allah, Chief Kamachi, MED, Rasco, and Wise Intelligent, among others, hit shelves early the following year.\n\nThe Snowgoons have already released 5 albums that feature a veritable who’s who of today’s underground elite! In 2011, Snowgoons collaborated with legendary New York duo M.O.P. to release the album Sparta, as well the album Your Favorite MC, with Philly's own Reef the Lost Cauze. \n\nThroughout the years, the buzz surrounding the Snowgoons has steadily escalated as their gritty, authentic and eclectic beats have gained recognition in both the United States, as well as within the burgeoning European Hip-Hop scene. DJ Illegal & Sicknature also represent the Snowgoons liveshow and are killing stages from Europe to U.S.A. and Canada, with artists like M.O.P., La Coka Nostra, Army of the Pharaohs, Sabac Red, and many others. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Snowgoons\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
