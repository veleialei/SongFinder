She had her greatest success in Germany and Switzerland with her third album Je te dis vous, which reached 11th and 2nd place in the countries' charts respectively. A significant ingredient of her successful formula is her impressive stage presence; Kaas is almost constantly on tour internationally. In 2002 Kaas had her film debut in And now... Ladies and Gentlemen beside Jeremy Irons.\nKaas is currently on a world tour since the end of 2008 to promote her latest album kabaret.
