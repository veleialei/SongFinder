He released a solo album, Do That Thang, soon after.  The album sold poorly, however, with the European charts seemingly not ready for its hip-hop style.\nIt was followed by two singles, the title track 'Do That Thang', and 'Shirley'.\n\nIn 1992 he met German producers Adler, Eisele and Keil, and they formed the Captain Hollywood Project, adding vocalist Nina to the group later that year.\n\nThe group issued two Eurodance-focused singles, 'More and More', and 'Only With You' in 1993.  Both were huge hits in a number of European charts.\n\nThe debut album, 'Love Is Not Sex', sold 400,000 copies in Europe.  It included 'More and More' and 'Only With You', plus the later singles 'All I Want' and 'Impossible', both released in early 1994.\n\nIn late May 1994, 'Rhythm Of Life' was sent to many radio stations as a promo maxi, but it was never officially released.\n\nIn 1995, after almost a year of silence, the group released their second album, 'Animals Or Human'.  It didn't match the sales of their debut album, but still shifted 200,000 copies.\nNina left the group to pursue a solo career and was replaced by Petra.  Dawson-Harrison then established his own record company and studio called Hollywood Productions.\n'Animals or Human' also featured a number of new producers, including Jurgen Katzmann of Culture Beat fame, and Attack II.\n\nThree singles followed the release of the album, 'Flying High', 'Find Another Way' and 'The Way Love Is'.  The first two singles were again huge hits, but 'The Way Love Is' was a slight failure in comparison.\n\nIn mid-1996, the group teamed up with Alex Belcher, Force and Miles Gordon for the production of their third album.  'Over and Over', the first single for the forthcoming album, was a popular club hit during the summer.  Notably the group had ditched the 'Project' part of their name, and were now named 'Captain Hollywood'.\n\nThe album included two more singles, 'Love and Pain' and 'The Afterparty', both in remixed form.  Both singles flopped.\n\nThe group disbanded later on in the year. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Captain+Hollywood+Project\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
