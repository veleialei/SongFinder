She shot to fame in 1999 with the Mast soundtrack. In 2001 she won the RD Burman Award for Most Promising Newcomer. \n\nCurrently she is one of the top playback singers in Bollywood - having sung for top actresses such as: Rekha, Sridevi, Madhuri Dixit, Karisma Kapoor, Kajol, Urmila Matondkar, Rani Mukherji, Aishwarya Rai, Sushmita Sen, Kareena Kapoor, Bipasha Basu, Priyanka Chopra, Katrina Kaif, Lara Dutta, Vidya Balan, Deepika Padukone, Sonam Kapoor, Asin, Anushka Sharma, Sonakshi Sinha, Parineeti Chopra and Alia Bhatt.\n\nShe started her singing career at a very early age of four. She participated in many competitions and made her presence felt. Her family soon shifted to Mumbai when Tabassum, a TV host spotted her talent and expressed to her parents that she could further her career if they went to Mumbai. She became quite famous through the various competitions she participated in. Her performances were telecast all over India through the National Television channel Doordarshan, through the music show Meri Aawaz Suno where she won the \"Lata Mangeshkar Trophy\" for the best female singer of India along with Pradip Somasundaran in the male category. This was the first such televised contest in India in 1996. Her first break in a Hindi film was in the film Shastra followed by Gang, Veergati, Dahek, Bade Dilwala, Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat, Shyam Benegal's Samar and the Vidhu Vinod Chopra film Mission Kashmir. She had no formal training before she entered into various national singing competitions. Lata Mangeshkar offered to train her when she won on the nationally-telecast \"Meri Aawaz Suno\"\n\nHer singing career got a big boost when Sandeep Chowta gave her the first major break in Mast. After Mast there was no turning back. Sunidhi Chauhan had been getting lots of criticism for an extremely mature voice despite being young. However this criticism ended once Chameli came with her biggest song to date \"Bhaage Re Mann\" and today she and Nihira Joshi are known as the most versatile singers since Kavita Krishnamurthy and Asha Bhosle. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sunidhi+Chauhan\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
