His first record release was with the group The Tots (who also included Norris Reid and in Brooks' words 'a guy called Tony'), who released a single in 1975 called \"Earth Is The Fullness\", recorded at Lee \"Scratch\" Perry's Black Ark studio, and released on Brooks' Harvest label. The band was not successful, but Brooks would often contribute to recording sessions at the Black Ark organized by Jah Lloyd. Brooks re-emerged as a solo singer in the mid-1970s, working with producers such as Alvin Ranglin, and achieving hits with singles such as \"Guiding Star\" (1977), \"Come Sister Love\", \"Grooving\", \"Open The Door\", and \"What a Gathering\". He also recorded the combination single \"Who Have Eyes To See\" with Prince Far I. He moved to the United Kingdom, and joined the British Reggae Artists Against Famine Appeal, singing on the \"Let's Make Africa Green Again\" charity single. In 1990 he recorded an album with Glen Brown, and followed it in 1995 with Hardcore Lover, an album on which he was joined by Delroy Wilson and Pat Kelly.\n\nBrooks also worked as a producer, and along with Jah Lloyd, set up his own 'Teams' label in the late 1970s.\n\nAlbums\n\nWhat a Gathering (1976) Burning Sounds\nTrue Love (1977) Harvest\nRum Drinker (197?)
