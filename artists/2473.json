He grew up in a musical family where his older brother played electric guitar in a band, and Lauria used to go to their concerts attempting to mimic the behavior at home with his  violao.  As a youth he heard repeatedly Beatles 'releases as well as popular Brazilian musicians in the 1970s .  On his own, he listened to the music and learned gradually more chord rows and his admiration for music grew.  Unlike music schools' educational approach Lauria learned to improvise and take pleasure in their own \"discoveries\" in the music. .\n\n By age 12, he was active in many school productions and was often seen on local television and theater.  At the age of 15 went Lauria to a music festival in Brazil, called \"Abertura\".  There he met national music at a high level, and especially he noticed a guitar duo named Burnier & Cartier .. Other musicians who were present at the festival were, among others, Milton Nascimento with Clube da Esquina, Ivan Lins , Djavan and Egberto Gismonti .  By age 16 he made ​​his first self-produced song (called \"Jangadeiro\"), this can be translated like \"boat man\", and this is said to have been crucial to his career choice, he would become a composer . \n\nAnother group influenced Nando , they were the vocal group Boca Livre (Free Mouth in English ).  With this release, he was playing in the local community.In 1980 , when at age 20, he entered the local music conservatory (Pernambuco Conservatory of Music). . Lauria did so access to grants from the Brazilian government to study music at the University of Berklee in California , USA from 1983 .   Nando chose to study a wide range of musical genres rather than specialize.  He studied the film , counterpoint , harmony and ear training . In 1987 he graduated with a bachelor's degree in Professional Music. \n\nThe original plan to go directly back to Brazil, was soon changed when he was asked to attend a concert by jazz group Pat Metheny Group in 1988 .  The group was already well recognized and had won several Grammy awards already and Lauria accepted the offer.  Together they played a series of concerts at the Night Stage Club in Cambridge, Massachusetts .  The plans to return to Brazil was more vague with time. In 1993 Nando signed a recording contract with Narada Records and released two solo albums .All the tracks were self composed and self-produced albums and went into the lists of the best contemporary jazz published by Billboard Magazine. His songs were recorded in the U.S. , Canada , most of Europe , of course, South America , but also Asian countries heard his songs on the radio .  Nando Lauria has over 20 projects with Narada, and has performed with great musicians since his breakthrough.  In 2005 he became an official member of the Pat Metheny Group  and he tours with them ever since.\n\nDISCOGRAPHY\n1992: Alma Del Sur 1992: Alma Del Sur \n1992: Narada Christmas Collection, Vol. 2 1992: The Narada Christmas Collection, Vol 2 \n1993: Wind and Reed 1993: Wind and Reed \n1993: Narada Decade : The Anniversary Collection 1993: Narada Decade: The Anniversary Collection \n1993: Earth Songs 1993: The Earth Songs \n1993: Music for Guitar: Passion 1993: Music for Guitar: Passion \n1994: Points of View 1994 Points of View \n1995: The Narada Collection, Vol. 5 1995: The Narada Collection Vol 5 \n1995: Close To The Heart 1995: Close To The Heart \n1995: Christmas Blessings : Narada Christmas Collection, Vol. 3 1995: Christmas Blessings: Narada Christmas Collection, Vol 3 \n1996: Novo Brasil 1996: Novo Brasil \n1997: Narada Smooth Jazz 1997: Narada Smooth Jazz \n1997: Narada World : A Global Vision 1997: Narada World: A Global Vision \n1998: The Best of Narada Christmas 1998: The Best of Narada Christmas \n1998: Narada Guitar : 15 Years of Collected Works 1998: Narada Guitar: 15 Years of Collected Works \n1998: Christmas Moods 1998: Christmas Moods \n1999: Latino Christmas 1999: Latino Christmas \n2000: Narada Guitar, Vol. 2 2000: Narada Guitar, Vol 2 \n2001: Narada Decade, Vol. 2 : Evolution 1992-2001 2001: Narada Decade, Vol 2: Evolution 1992-2001 \n2002: Nature of Narada 2002: Nature of Narada \n2003: Passion / Romance 2003: Passion / Romance \n2003: Narada Classic : Earth Songs / Precious Waters 2003: Narada Classic: Earth Songs / Precious Waters \n2003: Narada Classic : Novo Brasil & Points of View 2003: Narada Classic: Novo Brasil & Points of View \n2003: Christmas Chill 2003: Christmas Chill \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nando+Lauria\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
