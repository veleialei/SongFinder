The group was named 'Liquid feat Sylvie' but this one existed already, so it became 'Sylver'.\nThe group's vocalist is Silvy de Bie (born January 4, 1981) and keyboardist/songwriter is Wout Van Dessel (born October 19, 1974). Regi Penxten is the producer and co-songwriter.\n\nSilvy began her musical career at the age of nine on the Belgian television series De Kinderacademie (The Children's Academy). Belgian law prohibiting children under 16 from working, however, put a sudden end to this career. Later, she returned with the band \"Lance\".\n\nWout is a well known Belgian DJ. He and Silvy were acquainted at the disco where he was the resident DJ.\n\nSylver has not only toured its homeland of Belgium, but also North America, South Africa, Asia, Scandinavia, and Eastern Europe.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 2001 Sylver hit Germany with their debut album Chances, including the single \"Turn the Tide\". The single immediately moved to number 8 in the charts, and within 8 weeks was number 2 (under Atomic Kitten's Whole Again), staying in the top 10 for 12 weeks. A month later, the album debuted at 16 and spent 49 weeks in the top 100. The single Forever In Love also made the charts.\n\nThe second album, Little Things (2003) was no less successful, with the singles \"Livin' My Life\" and \"Why Worry\".\n\nOn November 2, 2004, the third album, Nighttime Calls, was released. The first single from this album, \"Love is an Angel\", hit the Belgian top 10 immediately upon its release on September 20.\n\nTheir fourth album, \"Crossroads\", was released in Europe on the 19th of May 2006.  The first single from the latter album was \"Lay All Your Love On Me\".\n\nA greatest hits album was released in 2007 featuring two new songs, including their newest single, \"The One\". \n\nThe group went on hiatus in 2007 while Silvy had her daughter (named Noor, born November 7th, 2007) but has since resumed performing in early 2008. \n\nIn addition to synthesizer and drum machine, Sylver uses guitar, piano, and percussion instruments.\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n\n    * Chances (2001)\n    * Little Things (2003)\n    * Nighttime Calls (2004)\n    * Crossroads (2006)\n    * Best Of: The Hit Collection 2001-2007 (2007)\n    * Sacrifice (2009)\n\nSingles\n\n    * Turn The Tide (2000)\n    * Skin\n    * Forgiven\n    * Forever In Love\n    * In Your Eyes\n    * Livin' My Life (2003)\n    * Why Worry\n    * Shallow Waters\n    * Wild Horses\n    * Love Is An Angel (2004)\n    * Make It\n    * Take Me Back\n    * Lay All Your Love On Me (2006)\n    * One Night Stand\n    * Why\n    * The One (2007)\n    *One World, One Dream (2008)\n    * Rise Again (2008)\n    * I Hate You Now (2009)\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sylver\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
