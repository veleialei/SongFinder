While he has enjoyed a decorated music ministry receiving Stellar Awards, Gospel Music Excellence Award as well as Grammy, Soul Train Music and Dove Award Nominations, he has also been honored in his hometown of Grand Rapids Michigan. Recognized for his professional and philanthropic efforts, Pastor Sapp has received the city’s highest African American honor, a Giants Award , as well as the Frederick Douglas award from the National Association of Negro and Professional Women’s Club.\n     \n   Not complacent, yet pressing towards the mark currently as Founder and Senior Pastor of Lighthouse Full Life Center Church, one of the fastest growing churches in Western Michigan,  Marvin is innovative in his approach to winning the lost and edifying the believer. As a native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, Pastor Marvin is committed to his community and enjoys taking the message to the masses. In its inaugural year, the ministry has initiated a Full Life approach with an emphasis of addressing the spiritual, physical and mental needs of the body. By no means is Pastor Marvin and the Lighthouse family resting on its laurels or taking credit for the well-rounded and effective ministry approach. In fact, with humility, they acknowledge they have found the formula for a successful ministry based on the Bible and cultivated through an intimate relationship with God.\n\n   Pastor Marvin is united in covenant to(Late) First Lady MaLinda Sapp, a gifted speaker, local\ncollege professor and Limited Licensed Psychologist, who also serves as Administrative Pastor. They have three wonderful children; Marvin II, Mikaila and Madisson.\n\n(2) Recruited for the legendary gospel group Commissioned while still a relative unknown, Marvin Sapp recorded with the group until its dissolution in 1995, and then began his own solo career with a self-titled album the following year. Born and raised in Grand Rapids, MI (where he has based his JOY Ministries outreach), Sapp debuted with Commissioned in the early '90s after Keith Staten left for solo work. He recorded the Commissioned albums Number 7 and Matters of the Heart with members Fred Hammond, Mitchell Jones, Mike Williams, and Karl Reid; after Hammond and Williams left as well, Sapp recorded the group's final album, 1996's Irreplaceable Love. By that time Sapp had signed a solo contract too, and March 1996 saw the release of his self-titled debut on Word Records. The album reunited him with former Commissioned mate Fred Hammond (who produced the LP) and featured the gospel hits \"Calling Me\" and \"In His Presence.\" Sapp's sophomore effort, Grace & Mercy, appeared in May 1997, followed two years later by Nothing Else Matters. After a short absence from the music scene, he reappeared under contract at Versity Records and released the song \"I Believe\" on the WOW Gospel 2002 album, followed by the album I Believe later in 2002. Diary of a Psalmist appeared in 2003, Be Exalted in 2005, and Thirsty in 2007. Here I Am, which debuted higher in the Billboard charts than any gospel album in 50 years, arrived in 2010. I Win followed in 2012. ~ John Bush, Rovi\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Marvin+Sapp\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
