Since the successful independent release of NEeMA’s debut album «Masì Cho» in 2006, she has toured Canada, Ireland, Australia, England and the US. \nNEeMA released her second album, «Watching You Think», in 2010, a collection of twelve stories seamlessly melding elements of world music, folk, and jazz with a good measure of pop. Produced in association with Leonard Cohen, who also draw the album-cover, and Pierre Marchand (Sarah McLachlan, Ron Sexsmith), «Watching You Think» contains songs of love, life and simple observations. NEeMA’s uninhibited and authentic style is complemented perfectly by some of Montreal's best musicians, who add nuance to every mood and emotion. The musicians include Howard Bilerman, Tim Kingsbury (Arcade Fire), Tom Mennier (Martha and Rufus Wainwright), Joe Grass and Miles Perkin (Lhasa de Sela), and Gurpreet Chana (Nelly Furtado). Also assisting with the album’s production are Haig V and Fred Bouchard.   <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Neema\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
