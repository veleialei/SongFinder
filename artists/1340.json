Huff auditioned for the third season of American Idol in Houston, Texas; he was a member of the fourth group of semifinalists. He was actually not among those originally chosen for the semifinal round, but was put through when contestant Donnie Williams was disqualified for a drunk driving arrest.\n\nHuff was not voted through to the final round from his group of semifinalists, but got another second chance when he was brought back for the wildcard round and put through as a finalist by contest judge Simon Cowell. During this period, New Orleans Fox Affiliate WVUE would hold specials including Huff's family cheering George on during the latest episodes.\n\nOn May 5, 2004, Huff was voted off in fifth place after two renditions of Fred Astaire's \"Cheek to Cheek\" and Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\" during big band week.\n\nHis album, Miracles, was released by Word Records, on October 11, 2005. The first single off that album was Brighter Day. It sold a mere 18,000 copies.\n\nIn 2005 his Louisiana home was affected by Hurricane Katrina. He left New Orleans and stayed at his brother's house in Dallas. 1\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/George+Huff\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
