Known for his stupefying and unbridled command of the keyboard throughout the 90s, his recent work has shown broader range.\n\nHe used to play with drummer Horacio 'El Negro' Hernández in the 80's, back in the days when they were still unknown in the international musical scene; They went to an european jazz festival and from there they began their flight to history.\n********************************************************************************************************************\nThe following info was collected from http://www.g-rubalcaba.com/g-rubalcaba.bio.html\n\nGonzalo Julio Rubalcaba was born in Habana, Cuba, May 27, 1963, into a musical family rich in the traditions of the country’s artistic past.  \nDuring his childhood, in addition to the standard fare of elementary schools, \nGonzalo was absorbing his Cuban musical heritage through personal contacts within his family, notably his father, \npianist Guillermo Rubalcaba, and leading musicians who were frequent houseguests: Frank Emilio, Peruchin, Felipe Dulzaides and others.  \nHe also assimilated through scarce and treasured recordings the tunes and styles of 40’s – 70’s US jazz masters: \nThelonius Monk, Bud Powell, Oscar Peterson among pianists; and instrumentalists Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Art Blakey.  \n\nGonzalo loved drumming, and early in his career studied both piano and drums.  \nHe began his classical musical training at Manuel Saumell Conservatory at age 9, \nwhere he finally had to choose piano; he moved up to “middle-school” at Amadeo Roldan Conservatory, \nand finally earned his degree in music composition from Havana’s Institute of Fine Arts in l983.  \nBy that time he was already playing in clubs and music halls in Havana.  \nWith Orquesta Aragon he toured France and Africa in 1980.  \nHe introduced his own \"Grupo Projecto\" to the North Sea and Berlin Festivals in l985.  \n\nIn July 1990 he appeared as a surprise guest with Charlie Haden and Paul Motian at Montreux Festival, Switzerland, \nin a historic performance (available as the CD Discovery).\nEgrem Studios of Havana was the first to record his music during the early and mid ‘80’s, \nand these discs are still being released (recently Inicio, an album of piano solos, and Concierto Negro.)  \n\nBeginning in 1986 Gonzalo began recording for Messidor of Frandfurt, Germany, \nand put out three superb albums for that label with his Cuban Quartet, Mi Gran Pasion, Live in Havana, and Giraldilla.\n1986 was also notable because of his chance meeting in Havana with bassist Charlie Haden.  \nThrough Charlie he came to the attention of Blue Note Records’ president, Bruce Lundvall, and thus began an association, \nfirst with Toshiba/EMI of Japan, and later with Blue Note in the US, which has resulted in eleven discs being released.  \nThese collaborations brought Gonzalo this year (2002) both a Latin Grammy for Jazz Album of the Year, Supernova, \nas well as a Grammy for co-production with Charlie Haden of Nocturne, a Verve release of Cuban and Mexican boleros and ballads.\n\nTo complement these wins, Gonzalo, in addition, has to his credit eight Grammy nominations, \nincluding four for Jazz Album of the Year (Rapsodia in 1995, Antiguo and Inner Voyage in 1999, and Supernova in 2002.)\nAmong other recent honors, in June 2001 Gonzalo received the SFJAZZ Leaders Circle Laureate Award, \nand in 2002 he performed as Artist in Residence at Montreal Jazz Festival together with Chucho Valdez.\n\nGonzalo married in November 1986 (as noted, a very eventful year for the pianist!!), and he and Maria now have three children, ages 6, 10 and 12.  \nTo enhance his career the family moved to Santo Domingo in 1992, and then to the US in November 1996.\n\nOur Maestro will continue shaping and reshaping the Afro-Cuban themes, forms and rhythms which have provided him with inspiration \nfor his life’s work.  He will be touring for the foreseeable future with his Trio  \n( Ignacio Berroa on drums and bassist Almando Gola ) with frequent guest appearances by tenor saxophonist David Sanchez. \nIn whatever idiom he works, his future musical creations will be melodious, rhythmic and exciting, and bear in their intriguing intricacies \nthe artist’s inherent intention of transforming the daily routines of our lives into something more beautiful and significant. \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gonzalo+Rubalcaba\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
