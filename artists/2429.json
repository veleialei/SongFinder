Mr Brown is also a producer from Italy. Goes from electro glitch to hip hop chop. \n\"Mr Brown is from '84, but is not a dystopian novel.\n  Mr Brown is even his contrary.\n    Mr Brown reminds of you and your evil twin.\nUnite frames as well as sounds. Comes from Italy but can't stand soccer. It's retro, mais avant-garde. Makes all this noise because is the only way to get enough tired to sleep.\" His first release, the \"I Dance for Money EP\", was out June 2007, on Philtre Records [http://www.philtre.com]. \nThe remixes \"We Dance For Money\" have just been released (08/08) on Philtre and distributed through Kompakt mp3.
