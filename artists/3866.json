Drummer Cathy Green has also been a frequent member of the band since 1984.\nRilen was also a founder member of bluesy hard rockers Rose Tattoo. During X's first hiatus (1980-83), he formed the hard-working post punk outfit Sardine v, with his then wife, Stephanie Rilen. As of 2004, Rilen had settled on a fairly stable line up of his current project, Ian Rilen & the Love Addicts, who include Cathy Green on bass. The band have also issued a CD, \"Passion Boots & Bruises.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/X+(Australia)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
