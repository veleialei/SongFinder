The original members of the group were all formerly in Charanga Habanera and the early parts of their careers are covered in great depth in our now completed section on the four albums of the original Charanga Habanera: Love Fever, Hey You Loca, Pa' Que Se Entere La Habana and Tremendo Delirio. The story of the breakup and the early years of Charanga Forever is covered in the article \"Charanga Habanera: The Breakup and Beyond\". We also have a long article written by former Charanga Forever pianist/arranger Juan Carlos González, and an interview with former bassist/leader  Pedro Pablo Gutiérrez. Both of these articles are available in both English and Spanish. Finally, we have Allan Johnston's article: \"The Bass Style of Pedro Pablo Gutiérrez\".\n\nClick on DISCS above to read our short reviews of the three Charanga Forever CD's. We'll be covering them in much greater detail soon..\n\nWe're also trying to learn more about the current incarnation of Charanga Forever, which contains original members Mario \"Sombrilla\" Jiménez, Pedro Polledo and Victor Sagarra, plus a new cast of characters, and is apparently still going strong in Havana. If you have information, recordings or jpg's of the current group, please contact us at: kevin@timba.com. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charanga+Forever\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
