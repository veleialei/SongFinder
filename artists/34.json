Vocalist Frank Pellerin took over for Bouchard on 2003's Cease to Suffer. Later that year, the band signed with Victory Records. Still under contract to Cyclop Records, the band released the EP Rehearsal to fulfill their contract obligation. Their first full length album for Victory was 2004's Unbroken. After the release of Unbroken, Pellerin left the band and was replaced by Tennessee native singer Kevin Randel to release 2005's Strength through Vengeance. Less than one month after releasing their fourth full length album, 2007's War of Aggression, the band decided to call it quits. The decision came after their tour support was pulled by Victory Records.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/A+Perfect+Murder\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
