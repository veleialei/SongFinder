Deriving their name from a character in the Irish mythology-inspired Sláine comics, the band released their self-titled debut album in 1996. To date, they have released nine studio albums, the most recent being 'Digital Resistence' (2014).\n\nSlough Feg was formed in Central Pennsylvania, but relocated to San Francisco, California in 1990 with the hopes of \"resurrecting the Heavy Metal scene in America\". The band produced three demo tapes in the early 90s before releasing their self titled debut album. Bassist Justin Phelps left the band shortly after. In 1998, the European music label Dragonheart signed Slough Feg and the band released their second album 'Twilight of the Idols' in 1999. The band released 'Down Among the Deadmen' in 2000, and 'Traveller' in 2003 (renowned for being based on Game Designer Workshop's 1977 science fiction role-playing game of the same name)..\n\nIn 2005 the band moved to the Italian record label Cruz del Sur and released their fifth studio album, 'Atavism'. The band also officially shortened their name to 'Slough Feg' after the album's release. After the change of name, John Cobbett left in good terms with the band, and was replaced by current member Angelo Tringali in January of 2005. Around the same time, drummer and founding member Greg Haa left the band for personal reasons, and was replaced by current member, Antoine Reuben-Diavola. In 2007 released their sixth album (second with Cruz del Sur), 'Hardworlder', recorded and produced with former bass player Justin Phelps. In 2008 the band released 'The Slay Stack Grows' on Shadow Kingdom Records. This was a double CD release of old demos and live recordings from the bands early days.\n\nThe band toured in Europe, and the United States, doing coast-to-coast tours summers of 2005 and 2006, including an appearance at the first annual Alehorn of Power festival in Chicago, Illinois. The band has also toured the United States, doing a coast-to-coast tour for the first time in the summer of 2005 with another such tour planned for the summer of 2006, which will include an appearance at the first annual Alehorn of Power festival in Chicago, IL.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Lord+Weird+Slough+Feg\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
