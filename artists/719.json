They gained a contract from the UK dance record label Rhythm King and were put in the recording studio with the record producer trio Beatmasters, who put them in a house music direction.\n\nIn December 1987, the resultant single \"Rok Da House\" (a.k.a. Rok Da House (feat. Cookie Crew)\" (no relation to the dance single \"Rock Da House\" by Scoop) was a hit in the nightclubs and crossed-over into the mainstream, becoming a UK Singles Chart success. The track is often quoted as being the first hip house record. \n\nThe duo moved on to another label, FFRR Records and different producers, resulting in a string of hit singles in 1989, with \"Born This Way (Let's Dance)\", \"Got To Keep On\" and \"Come And Get Some\"; plus the \"Born This Way\" which reached a modest number 24 in the UK Albums Chart.\n\nBy 1992 there were differences of opinion with their then label London Records over musical direction, and the duo parted company to pursue separate projects. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cookie+Crew\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
