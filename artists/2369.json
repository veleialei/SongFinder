For the remaining albums and for tours, Willy DeVille assembled musicians to play under the name Mink DeVille. After 1985, when Willy DeVille began recording and touring under his own name (saying that he felt tired of being referred to as 'Mink' after performances), his backup bands were sometimes called 'The Mink DeVille Band,' an allusion to the earlier 'Mink DeVille' group. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mink+DeVille\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
