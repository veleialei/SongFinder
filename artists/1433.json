Russell set the table for the free improv and free jazz scene which exploded later in the 90's in Chicago.\n\nCited by some as a missing link between the AACM and later Chicago free jazz, Russell was experiencing greater public awareness before his death. He recorded or performed with Ken Vandermark, Steve Hunt, Kent Kessler, Brian Sandstrom, Mars Williams, and The Flying Luttenbachers. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Hal+Russell\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
