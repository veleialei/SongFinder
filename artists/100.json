In a short period of time since teaming up with Sweden’s Giant label Joia Records, Albin has been given the great possibility of remixing some of the biggest artist and project in today’s Dance Music scene. \n\nIn a career now spanning a little over 12 months is Albin considered one of Joia & Nero’s leading production & remixing talent. \n\nAlbin’s next 12 months look to eclipse the heady days of the first – remixing artists such as David Guetta & Kelly Rowland, Erick Morillo, Tom Novy, EDX, DONS & Greg Cerrone,DBN Tommy Trash for MOS Australia and delivering original productions for Serial, Pickadoll and the UK’s own Defected. \n\nAnd of course his own Release on Nero recordings, a take on the classic Foo Fighters ‘Times Like These’ (a track which has been licensed globally & supported far and wide by the biggest Dj names in dance industry). \n\nThe future looks even brighter than it already does for this highflying artist.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Albin+Myers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
