On his first album \"Billo De Ghar\" his name appears as simply \"Abrar\". His best-known work is the song \"Billo De Ghar\". Before becoming a singer, he was a teacher at Lahore's Aitchison College.\n\n== Music and style ==\nAbrar's music is sometimes considered of [[bhangra]] [[genre]], however, three genres, ‎‎[[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[bhangra]] overlap in his musical work. His ‎most popular songs are in Punjabi language, although, he has sung almost equal number of ‎Urdu songs which are parts of all of his albums.‎\n\nHis [[Urdu]] language songs have not gained that kind of popularity which has been earned by his ‎Punjabi work. It is partly because of the vast difference of his style in these two ‎languages. His most Punjabi songs are upbeat, and lyrics are very down to earth ‎representing [[Pakistan]]i culture with a humorous touch and clever sarcasm. On the ‎other hand his Urdu music is mostly sad, romantic and patriotic. In some of his Urdu ‎songs, he has copied some Urdu classics of Pakistani music.‎\n\nAlthough, beat is an essential part of Abrar's music but he choses his melodies very carefully and always tries to keep them consistent with the beat. He writes most of his songs, however, he often borrows poetry from [[Sufi]] poets of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] which he cleverly mixes up in his humours songs.\n\n== Pioneer ==\nAbrar-ul-Haq is arguably the pioneer of bhangra music in [[Pakistan]] and one of most ‎influential musical figures of his country. He is considered ''The King of Pakistani Pop'' by ‎some fans.‎\n\nHe emerged in the era of heavy metal [[guitar]] and with predominantly [[Urdu]] language pop ‎music. His debut single was a Punjabi song ''[[Billo De Ghar]]'' (Billo's home) which was ‎an instant hit.‎\n\n== SAHARA for Life Trust ==\nHe is the founder and chairman of ''[[SAHARA for Life Trust]]'' (tax exempted charity organization), a charitable organisation promoting health and education in remote areas. The term SAHARA stands for: \"'''S'''ervices '''A'''imed at '''H'''ealth and '''A'''wakening in '''R'''emote '''A'''reas\".\n\nThe abbreviation SAHARA has been chosen very cleverly as it is Roman script or [[transliteration]] for a word of [[Urdu]] ('''سہارا''') which means ''aid'' or ''assistance''.\n\n== Discography ==\n<!--Kindly Do not add any chart positions here, keep this list as short as possible-->\n=== Regular studio albums ===\n* [[Billo De Ghar]] ([[1995]])\n* [[Majajni]] ([[1997]])\n* [[Bay Ja Cycle Tay]] ([[1999]])\n* [[Assan Jana Mall-o Mall]] ([[February 5]], [[2002]])\n* [[Nachan Main Audhay Naal]] ([[June 1]], [[2004]])\n* [[Naara Sada Ishq Aey]] ([[March]], [[2007]])\n\n=== Hits compilations / Studio albums ===\n* [[Mein Gaddi Aap Chalawan Ga]] ([[2000]])\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Abrar-Ul-Haq\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
