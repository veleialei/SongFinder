The band was formed in 1978 by American rock singer Patrick Mata, who was influenced by musicians Throbbing Gristle, David Bowie and Joy Division as well as other artistic inspirations like Dadaism, anti-art, noise, musique concrète, and the Brion Gysin/William Burroughs cut-up technique.\n\nThough initially named \"Kommunity Fuck\", after a piece of paste-up art created by Mata, the moniker was soon shortened. Mata has stated that the name was inspired by the cold shoulder given him by unimaginative local media venue talent buyers as well as industry powers.\n\nKommunity FK's debut album, The Vision and the Voice, was released in 1983. The follow-up, 1985's Close One Sad Eye, garnered significant attention when a video clip for the song \"Something Inside Me Has Died\" received significant play on MTV. Fifteen years later, Kommunity FK returned with their third effort, the collection Abandoned Here... Planet Ruled By Bastards, followed by La Santisima Muerte in 2010.\n\nDuring a Kommunity FK hiatus in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mata led the band Sativa Luvbox, who released two albums: The Bad Sleep Well (1989, Splat-Co Records) and Beloved Satellite (1993, Gasoline Alley Records). Mata had earlier issued a 1979 single, \"The Queen Of Beverly Hills,\" under his own name. Using the name Texylvania, he also covered songs on several tribute albums.\n\nKommunity FK has performed with: \nPIL\nKilling Joke\nAlien Sex Fiend\nSpecimen\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain\nSex Gang Children\nChristian Death & Shadow Project\nPeter Murphy\nNina Hagen\nToys Dolls\nLords Of The New Church\nModern English\nGun Club\nNick Cave\nGene Loves Jezebel\nFlesh For Lulu\n45 Grave\nLydia Lunch\nThe Virgin Prunes\nXmal Deutschland\nClan Of Xymox\nand more legendary bands. \n\nWith Mata's world wide following Kommunity FK is the most covered band for inspiring today's genre of gothic and industrial music. Artists such as Perry Farrell of Janes Addiction, Elijah Blue Allman (Cher's and Greg Allman's son) of Deadsy (Deadsy has covered and recorded numerous Kommunity FK songs such as 'No Fear', 'Bullets', 'Anti-Pop', and more), Jonathon Davis of Korn, Axl Rose of Guns n' Roses, and many others attribute Kommunity FK as one of their main influences. \n\nAuthor Brendan Mullen has written the biography of Jane's Addiction and Perry Farrell titled \"Whores\" (released in June of 2005), in which Patrik Mata of Kommunity FK is a fairly large part of, being mentioned several times throughout the book. Perry Farrell was so taken by Patrik Mata he followed him to Mata's place of work (Fiorucci in the year 1978) just to stare at Mata and his unique star demeanor and stylish fashions. Farrell's biography written by Dave Thompson in the '90s mentions Patrik Mata and his influence upon the L.A. underground music scene numerous times. Once Farrell decided to start making his own music his Kommunity FK influences became more than obvious when he incorporated barking dogs at the beginning of the Jane's Addiction song \"Been Caught Stealing\" in the mid 1990s. Farrell took this idea from Kommunity FK's song \"Incompatible Disposition\" written in 1979, that is found on the Kommunity FK album \"The Vision and The Voice.\" \n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kommunity+FK\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
