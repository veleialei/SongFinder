Broderick Steven \"Steve\" Harvey (born January 17, 1957 in Welch, West Virginia) is an American actor, entertainer and comedian. He later moved to Cleveland, Ohio and graduated from Glenville High School in 1974.\n\nHarvey began doing stand-up comedy in the mid 1980s, eventually leading to a long stint as host of It's Showtime at the Apollo, succeeding his colleague Mark Curry in that role. His success as a stand-up comedian led to The WB network giving him his own show, The Steve Harvey Show, which ran from 1996 to 2002. While wildly popular in the African-American community (the show won multiple NAACP Image Awards), the show never achieved critical acclaim outside of the African-American community, a matter about which Harvey has often complained.\n\nIn 1997, Harvey continued his work in stand-up comedy, touring as one of the Kings of Comedy, along with Cedric the Entertainer, D.L. Hughley and Bernie Mac. The comedy act would later be put together into a film by Spike Lee called The Original Kings of Comedy.\n\nFollowing the end of his runs on Showtime at the Apollo and The Steve Harvey Show, Harvey continued acting in some minor roles, but has become a major figure in many African-American functions and is a staple on BET. In addition, he has released an audio CD of up-and-coming hip hop and R&B artists on a record label he founded, and has authored a book, Steve Harvey's Big Time. That title was also used as the name of Harvey's comedy and variety television show (later renamed Steve Harvey's Big Time Challenge) which aired on The WB network from 2003 until 2005.\n\nHarvey is divorced and has four children. Harvey is also a member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc.\n\n\nMorning show:\n\nHarvey also hosted his own radio morning radio show, The Steve Harvey Morning Show, syndicated under Radio One, Inc. broadcasting company, from September 2000 until May 2005. The Los Angeles-based show, although fairly successful in the L.A. market itself, was not as successful in its national syndication efforts as either Harvey or Radio One had hoped it would be. Ultimately, the show aired only in L.A. on KKBT, and in Dallas on KBFB, with Harvey splitting his time between the Dallas and L.A. studios. As a result, Harvey and Radio One decided to part ways shortly before his contract expired.\n\nIn September 2005, Harvey signed a joint syndication deal with Premiere Radio Networks and Inner City Broadcasting Corporation for a new incarnation of \"The Steve Harvey Morning Show\"; the show is based out of WBLS in New York. \"The Kings of Comedy\" DVD and \"Don't Trip, He Ain't Through With Me Yet\", have increased Steve Harvey's brand recognition among African Americans. During the past two years, Harvey has launched the popular Steve Harvey clothing line which features the line of dress wear which has made him popular with the 40+ crowd. Steve Harvey regularly works with Bud Abbott, who appears with him in the studio.
