Another Curtis Mayfield song, The Monkey Time, in 1963, reached number 2 on the R & B charts and number 8 pop, and the partnership continued with further hits including Um Um Um Um Um Um. \n\nThe Mighty Majors(\"You Can Never Go Back\") also were his back up band once.\n\nHe had less success after breaking his relationships with Mayfield and OKeh, releasing records on several labels into the early 1970s, including Osiris Records which he set up with Al Jackson. He then moved to England for two years in the 1970s, and after returning to the USA served a prison term for cocaine possession. He made few performances after a heart attack in 1987.   <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Major+Lance\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
