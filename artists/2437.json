Bounding onto the stage with long hair, guitars and soaring harmonies, the four sisters of Mulberry Lane are winning plenty of fans. \n\nMulberry Lane, who has sold over 600,000 CDs, grew up singing and performing together.  Their signature four-part harmony has taken them around the world, up the charts (to # 25 US pop/top 40 chart; #6 in Japan), on national and international TV and radio shows (including Good Morning America, Regis, CBS This Morning, CNN, VH-1, Fox, Delilah, John Tesh, and nationally televised National Anthems on ESPN and NBC), and into the homes of Mulberry Lane fans in over 16 countries.  They have played for crowds of up to 130,000, and television viewing audiences of up to eleven million. \n\nMulberry Lane is poised to release a new studio album in spring 2007, called \"Snug.\"  This year will also mark the sisters' fourth annual holiday tour (1500 - 2500 seat theaters).  Growing every year, the show features their critically acclaimed harmonies, endless energy, and onstage banter.  It's a full stage production, with their four piece band and moving lights. \n\nThe tour supports their latest release, \"A Very Merry Mulberry Christmas.\" This disc, a collection of contemporary and traditional songs, showcases the unmatched blend of the four singer-songwriter-sisters.  Five of the fifteen songs were written by the sisters.  USA Today music critics called the disc \"What's Hot\" and suggested it as part of their Holiday Gift Guide.  The CD went to #6 on Billboard's Midwest regional chart, and was featured on I-tunes as a staff favorite. \n\nTheir version of \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" was also released as a part of a Sony/BMG holiday compilation, \"Coming Home for Christmas\" in 2005.  The disc includes artists such as Amy Grant, Lonestar, Vince Gill, Trans Siberian Orchestra and more.  The sisters' version of \"Have Yourself\" was heard on over 400 radio stations across the country, and on the nationally syndicated shows \"Delilah,\" \"John Tesh,\" Sirius, XM, and \"Music Choice\" (in more than 35 million homes). \n\nJaymie, Rachel, Bo and Kat's story is as exciting as their music.  Inspired and driven, Mulberry Lane began to attract a loyal following performing their original music at coffeehouses throughout the Midwest area, accompanying themselves with guitars and percussion.  They cut an indie CD, \"Don't Cry 'Til You Get to the Car\" in 1999 which sold over 10,000 copies and started their climb. \n\nAggressively courted by a number of labels, the girls signed with Refuge/MCA, and released the single, \"Harmless,\" which they wrote, that climbed to No. 25 on the U.S. pop charts and No. 6 in Japan. The album \"Run Your Own Race\" followed, which they also wrote.  The girls quickly embarked on a whirlwind international tour which included the US, Canada, England, Ireland, Holland, France, Germany, and Japan.  Another single they wrote, \"Just One Breath,\" is featured on Kevin Costner's \"For the Love of the Game\" soundtrack \n\nNext, after performing the National Anthem and God Bless America at NFL, NBA, and NHL games, they released \"Stars & Stripes & Sisters Forever.\" This CD also includes two songs written by the sisters.  Critics called this release their best vocal performance to date.  They gave a powerful live performance of the National Anthem before NASCAR's Banquet 400, nationally televised on NBC to a viewing audience of six million, and again at the 2006 Nokia Sugar Bowl at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.\n\nSpring: 2007 will mark the nationwide release of \"Snug\" in the Spring and a release of the first single soon!\n\nMay 2007: All Access (music industry's #1 online trade pub) selected \"Crazy Love\" as one of four songs chosen as \"Cool New Music.\" They had this to say: \"Imagine four beautiful sisters, with great four-part harmonies singing a remake of the Poco Classic 'Crazy Love.' Mulberry Lane puts a new spin on this instantly recognizable song.\n\nJuly: Mulberry Lane's new single \"Crazy Love\" is now #9 with a bullet on the national light rock ACQB chart. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mulberry+Lane\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
