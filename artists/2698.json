The pianowork and string ensembles alone make these tracks a must-listen, but combined with lovingly twisted synths and digital sounds and beats hearkening from nearly forgotten corners of the world makes it even better. 'Universal Flow' is distinctly a step away from the cookie-cutter dubtronica downtempo heard so much these days... be sure to check this out while it's at its freshest! Leave your preconceptions at the door and let the Flow grab hold of you! \n\n\nAbout Catching Zinc\n\nPerpetual Loop's second album - Catching Zinc, will be released on 14th December 2009. Universal Flow (the first album) began in the ethnic universe but then swept you off into multi-universes, crossing boundaries, styles and perceptions, eventually leaving you in a world full of skipping beats, organic bleeps and a sense of loneliness. It was very much as studio release (a small bald-headed bloke scurrying around in the deeps of a dark room with a hand full of electronic gizmos and a plethora of effects and samples). In the three year gap, Charles' experiences have broadened by playing live gigs and a widened appreciation of downtempo music. The end result is a more musical, uplifting concept. The soundscapes are still there, but are now held together with stronger melodies and ideas, with many of the tracks tried and tested, to positive response, at live events over the past year.\nCatching Zinc begins exactly where Universal Flow ended, with a full on, chilled out, ethnic track. From there it introduces elements of cinematic, dub, jazz, lounge, drum and bass, all tied together by Perpetual Loop's unique production skills and sound. It's less thought provoking and just more plain fun, and yet for Charles, Catching Zinc is by far a much more personal, mature journey. And that's the key... just like Universal Flow this too is a journey, to far of places in the mind...\n\nAbout Universal Flow\n\nAs with Organic's earlier groundwork albums, Perpetual Loop can be expected to lead you on a mystifying musical journey through the psyche aboard a vehicle of some of the most chilled out world beats and magic carpets of synth atmospheres. 'Universal Flow' definitely fits that bill, and immersed within this amazing album are virtual teleportation devices to other places and times, some real, yet at the same time, wholly unimagined ... until now.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Perpetual+Loop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
