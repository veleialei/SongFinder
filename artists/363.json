A veteran stand-up performer, he got his start working clubs and making comedy albums, then moved into television with a vanguard role in the 1960s action show I Spy. \n\nIn 1967 Cosby reached #4 on the Hot 100 with his single Little Ole Man. According to the Little Ole Man Songfacts, Cosby was the first really famous comedian to have a Billboard-charting single, although many novelty songs charted by performers who certainly had \"comedian\" on their resum√©s. \n\nCosby later starred in his own series, The Bill Cosby Show, in the early 1970s, and created the humorous educational cartoon series Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, about a group of young friends growing up in the city. Cosby also acted in numerous films, although none has received the acclaim of his television work.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Cosby produced and starred in one of the decade's defining cultural products, The Cosby Show, which aired from 1984 to 1992 and featured an upper-class African-American family without resorting to the kinds of vulgar stereotypes previously seen among African-American characters in prime-time television. While some argued that The Cosby Show ignored the issues of racial inequity still prevalent in society, many agreed that it showcased positive role models.\n\nThe late 1990s and early 2000s brought trouble for Cosby, first in early 1997 with the death of his only son, Ennis, who was shot to death on a Los Angeles freeway in a random act of violence. Also that year, he was dragged into a court case that involved a young woman who was charged with extortion in claiming that he was her biological father - a shocking accusation that Cosby denied. Cosby admitted to having a one-time affair with the woman's mother.\n\nDespite these personal setbacks, Cosby did not slow down at all in the 1990s, starring in Cosby, which first aired in 1996, and hosting Kids Say the Darndest Things, which began in 1998, as well as making more movies. He has also continued appearing on the stand-up circuit, delighting audiences with his gentle, paternal brand of comedy. His material consists mainly of anecdotal tales, often dealing with his upbringing and raising his own family, and he is known for having a clean, kid-friendly routine. His good-natured, fatherly image has made him a popular personality and earned him the nickname of \"America's Black Dad,\" and he has also been a sought-after spokesman for products like Jell-O Pudding and Coca-Cola. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Cosby\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
