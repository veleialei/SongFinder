Montero is better known for his singing career; in fact, it was his career as a singer that has led him towards becoming an actor.\n\nKnown for his usage of \"charro\" hats and black clothing during his concerts, Montero is considered to be a teen idol and paparazzi favorite in Mexico. He is also well known in the rest of Latin America, Australia, Europe, and the Hispanic community of the United States.\n\nWhen Montero was a teenager, he had his first professional singing job as the lead singer of a group named \"Tr√©bol\", which had a number one hit titled \"Si tu Supieras\" (Spanish for \"If You Knew\"), a song that was later sung by Alejandro Fernandez for the soap opera a titled the same, where Adela Noriega and Fernando Carrillo stared as the protagonists.\n\nMontero opted for a career as a solo artist shortly after this, struggling in local bars and clubs until he got his big break in 1999 when his album, \"Donde Estas, Corazon?\" (\"Where Are You, My Heart?\") became the number one album on Mexico's charts. This in turn led to his acting debut in \"Vivo Por Elena\" (\"I Live for Elena\"), where he played a struggling young singer. This was followed by acting roles in \"Nunca te Olvidare\" (I Will Never Forget You\"), \"Abrazame muy Fuerte\" (\"Hold me Tight\"), \"Rebecca\", and \"Entre El Amor y El Odio\".\n\nHis 2000 album, the self titled \"Pablo Montero\", produced the number one hit \"Que Voy a Hacer sin Ti?\" (\"What am I Going to do Without You?\"). This album was followed by 2002's \"Pidemelo Todo\" (\"Ask Me for Everything\"), which also included a number one hit single in \"Hay Otra en tu Lugar\" (\"There's Another One in Your Place\"). Also in this latter album was the great hit to the soap opera \"Gata Salvaje\", which was titled the same as the soap opera and reached the top ten list on the charts. Later this year he was honored in Astralia for his acting as Martin in \"Rebecca\". He has composed the songs for various shows including \"Olvidarte Jamas\", \"Gata Salvaje\", \"La Revancha\", \"Abrazame Muy Fuerte\", \"Duelo de Pasiones\", and the controversial movie \"El Crimen del Padre Amaro\".\n\nMontero spent most of 2003 touring and preparing an album which was dedicated to legendary Mexican composer Javier Solis.\n\nIn 2005, an ad campaign was run by clothing company Hanes with the slogan \"Mira quien tiene Hanes\" (\"Look who we've got our Hanes on now\"). Mr Montero and Aracely Arambula both featured in the campaign for the Spanish language advertising. The English advertising campaign featured celebrities including Michael Jordan, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Marisa Tomei, Damon Wayans, and Matthew Perry. In 2006, the campaign added Kevin Bacon and Christina Applegate to their lineup.\n\nIn 2006, Montero starred in the Mexican soap opera Duelo de pasiones, which aired on Univision during 2007.\n\nIn January of 2007 Pablo was involved in a late night incident in Aspen, Colorado, resulting in his arrest. He broke the passenger side window of a VW Toureg belonging to Oren Alexander, after Oren asked him to step out of his vehicle. Pablo was arrested an hour later in his hotel room but was released the following day.\n\nHe's currently engaged to Argentine actress Sandra Vidal, and on June 2, 2007, announced that they were expecting a child. He currently faces a drug conviction in Miami, Florida after being caught speeding when police found cocaine in the car he was driving, which wasn't his. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pablo+Montero\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
