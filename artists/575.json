Ponce began his acting career by participating in Spanish language soap operas for Televisa and Telemundo. Ponce continued to expand his acting career by participating in various American television series. He did not limit himself solely to a career in television. Ponce, who is also a singer, is also active in the American movie industry as a character actor.\n\nHis parents, Carlos Ponce, Sr. and Esther Freyre, emigrated from Cuba after the Revolution and he was born in Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico. After his birth, the family moved to Humacao where Ponce was raised. As a child, he would actively participate in his school's plays and at home he would often put on a show for the family where he would sing the latest tunes. \"Carlitos\", as he is known in Puerto Rico, started to appear in television commercials at the age of six. He attended high school in Humacao and was a member of the school's drama club.\n\nIn 1986, the Ponce family moved to Miami, Florida and Ponce continued to participate in his school's productions. He was named the best student actor of the southern region of the United States.\n\nIn 1990, Ponce participated in the South eastern Theater Conference and competed for the chance to win a scholarship. He won and enrolled in the New World of the Arts Conservatory school of the University of Miami. However, the Spanish language television station Univision offered Ponce the opportunity to host a show called \"Hablando\" (Talking). This was his first serious television debut and after his debut he gave up his university studies.\n\nActing career\n\nAfter the show came to its end, Ponce went to Mexico to visit a friend. While there he visited the Televisa television station. The talent director of the station met Ponce and was very impressed with him. He offered Ponce a role in the soap opera \"Guadalupe\". Later he also participated in another soap opera for Televisa entitled \"Sentimientos Ajenos\", in which he played the main character. Ponce also sang the theme song for the production. He received the \"Actor Revelation of 1997 Award\" by Eres magazine and named \"Best Actor\" by TV y Novelas magazine (both are Mexican entertainment publications).\n\nIn between productions, Ponce returned to Miami and Univision hired him as the host of a new show to be called \"Control\". He hosted the show for three years and won an \"ACE Award\" for his effort. He hosted the Miss Universe 2006 pageant in Los Angeles, along Shandi Finnessey, Nancy O'Dell and Carson Kressley.\n\nIn 2003, Ponce joined Entertainment Tonight as a correspondent. He also hosted An Entertainment Tonight Event — Celebrity Weddings Unveiled, a CBS primetime special. Ponce, now no longer with ET, currently stars in the Telemundo serial Dame Chocolate (Give Me Chocolate). Ponce also starred in Perro Amor in 2010 on the same network. In 2012, Ponce began hosting the hit Puerto Rican singing competition for kids on Wapa Television called Idol Kids Puerto Rico. In 2013, Ponce appeared on Telemundo's Santa Diabla as Humberto Cano.\n\nMusical career\n\nIn 1998, Emilio Estefan signed Ponce to a record contract. His first album was entitled \"Carlos Ponce\" and included three of his own compositions. The album reached the #1 spot in the Latin Billboards for nine weeks in the Hispanic community of the United States. It also reached the #1 spot in Central America and South America.
