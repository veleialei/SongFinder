The album spawned the hit single \"My Definition of a Boombastic Jazz Style\", which featured a prominent sample of Soul Bossa Nova by Quincy Jones which originally appeared on his 1962 LP Big Band Bossa Nova and was also the theme music to the Canadian game show Definition.\n\nThe 1994 follow-up, Subliminal Simulation, received mixed reviews, and has since been forgotten by some and named a cult favourite by others; it featured guest vocals by Ishmael Butler of Digable Planets (on the track \"Tricycles and Kittens\"), and Guru and DJ Premier contributed to two different versions of the song called \"I've Lost My Ignorance (and Don't Know Where To Find It\").\n\nTheir most recent album, 1997's The Master Plan, was poorly received and did not sell well, but they made an appearance in 1999 for The Herbaliser on the track \"Road of Many Signs.\"\n\nDiscography\n\n    * 1991 - ...and now the Legacy Begins\n    * 1995 - Subliminal Situation\n    * 1996 - The Master Plan\n    * 1998 - Anthology: A Decade of Hits\n    * 2002 - Legacy Continues\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dream+Warriors\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
