The British hard-rock outfit Little Angels formed in Scarborough, England in 1987 while its members -- vocalist/guitarist Toby Jepson, keyboardist Jimmy Dickinson, his guitarist brother Bruce, bassist Mark Plunkett and drummer Dave Hopper -- were all attending university.\n\nAt the outset, the group was forced to hone their craft primarily in area schools, as Jimmy Dickinson was too young to play clubs. Originally dubbed Mr. Thrud, Little Angels issued their debut mini-LP Too Posh to Mosh (recorded with new drummer Michael Lee) in 1987.\n\nAfter winning a loyal following on the strength of their live performances, including an opening set for a then-unknown Guns 'N' Roses, they were signed to Polydor, releasing the full-length Don't Prey for Me in 1989. Produced by Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero, 1991's Young Gods attempted to break Little Angels in America, a move which proved unsuccessful. Still, the group's fanbase at home continued to grow, and 1993's Jam even debuted at the top of the British charts. To the surprise of many, Little Angels then disbanded, with the 1994 release of the retrospective Little of the Past marking their passing. The Dickinsons later resurfaced in b.l.o.w. \n\nLead vocalist Toby Jepson now sings for Scottish rockers - GUN! Jepson also has released 2 EP's with a view to doing a 3rd this coming summer.\n\n2. The Little Angels is an all-female folk-ballet troupe established by members of the Unification Church to attract positive attention to Korean culture and in particular to act as goodwill ambassadors for South Korea. It was founded by a former Korean military attache, Lieut. Colonel Bo Hi Pak, a top aide to Unification Church founder Sun Myung Moon in 1963. The group continues to perform to this day. The Little Angels are supported financially by the Tongil Group, a South Korean business group associated with the Unification Church, though the Tongil Foundation.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Little+Angels\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
