Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil met when they were both staff songwriters, they were married in 1961. Through the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, Mann came up with songs such as \"Sometimes When We Touch\" and movie scores such as that for I Never Sang for My Father. Weil co-wrote \"He's So Shy\" with Tom Snow for The Pointer Sisters and worked on projects with Lionel Richie.\n\nIn 1961, they wrote and Mann sang a novelty song that made the Top 10 with \"Who Put The Bomp\", which parodied the nonsense words of the then-recently popular doo wop songs.\n\nIn 1987, he was inducted with his wife into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Barry+Mann\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
