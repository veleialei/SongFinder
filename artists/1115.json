The song she sang was CoCo Lee's \"Love Me A While Longer 愛我久一點\". Also in the competition that year were 3 other Taiwanese celebrities, 183 Club member Jacky Chu 祝釩剛 (who was the winner), DJ Ruby Lu 盧春如 (1st Runner-Up) and 蜜雪薇琪 (Michelle*Vickie) member Michelle Hsu (now known as Mimi or Michelle).\n\nElva was originally signed to Virgin Records Taiwan, a sub-label of EMI, which created the stage name of 蕭亞軒 for her. Her self-titled debut album in 1999 sold over 1 million copies in Asia and cemented her status in the Chinese music industry. Virgin Records and Elva parted ways in summer of 2004. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Elva+Hsiao\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
