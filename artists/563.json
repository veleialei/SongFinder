Vasconcelo was also writing e.g. La Cream's \"You\" and Dr Alban's \"This Time I'm Free\". Jorge decided to establish a studio of his own in Västerås and left Dr. Records. The guys met Malin and Katia in November 1998 in a karaoke bar in Stockholm. Caramell's first singles \"Om du var min\" (If You Were Mine) and cover \"Efter plugget\" (After School) were quite big hits in Sweden. The band's debut album \"Gott och blandat\" was released in August in 1999. The song \"Jag ser på dig\" (I'm Looking at You) was released as a single in September 1999. The last single to be released by this project was the very powerful \"Explodera\". There are still some interesting euro tracks that can be found on the album, such as \"Kom och ta mig\" (Come Take Me), \"Telefon\" (Telephone) and \"Vingar\" (Wings).\n\nIn 2001 Caramell returned with a brand new album. It included eurodance tracks such as \"Vad heter du\" (What's Your Name), \"Spelar ingen roll\" (Doesn't Matter), and \"Kom håll om mig\" (Come Hold Me). \n\nA speed-up, but otherwise unedited version of their song Caramelldansen (entitled Caramelldansen (Speedycake remix)) has seen some internet popularity as the background music for a flash loop of Mai and Mii of the anime Popotan doing a dance from the show's opening, with one version simply being the looped chorus of the song, and the other being the full version.  In Japan, Caramelldansen(Speedycake remix) is known as U-U-Uma Uma (ウッーウッーウマウマ(°∀°)), a misinterpretation of the lyrics u-u-ua-ua, and received a special single release with 5 other remixes by such famous artists as Ryu*, as well as a video. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Caramell\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
