Santana bass guitar player Tom Rutley would move into to the bass spot with Azteca. That band, like Santana with heavy Latin influences, would eventually morph into Graham Central Station, while Schon would found Journey.\n\nGraham Central Station's biggest hit was Your Love, which charted at number 9 in 1975. The group integrated Graham's slap bass style along with influences ranging from marching band to gospel. They played with the dichotomy between the funk rock star image and the \"sanctified\" gospel group image. Some of their recordings feature their then Warner Bros labelmates Tower of Power horn section. Graham went solo in the later 1970's having a chart hit with \"One in a Million, You\".\n\nWhile no longer as popular as in the 70's, Larry Graham (born in Beaumont Texas in 1946) continues to tour & play music into the 21st century, most notably with Prince with whom he shares an interest in the Jehovah's Witness religion. In 1999, Graham recorded an album for Prince's label under the Graham Central Station moniker that featured old Sly Stone era bandmates Cynthia Robinson and sax player Jerry Martini and performed on Prince's \"Rave Un2 2000\" live DVD and appeared as a featured act throughout Prince's Jam of The Year tour. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Graham+Central+Station\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
