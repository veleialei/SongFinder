She came second in the final, but became a huge hit in Serbia and other ex-YU countries. \n\nHer second album, \"Devojka od čokolade'' (\"Chocolate girl\"), was released in late 2006. The most popular tracks from this album were the title track, \"Plakaćete za mnom oboje'', \"Dum jedan konjak\" and \"Klovn\".\n\nIn 2009, she took part at \"Beovizija\" one more time, with the song \"Bili smo najlepši'', but was told that she didn't make it to the final, which turned out to be a technical mistake. Because of that, she eventually refused to sing in the final. However, the song became very popular.\n\nIn July 2010, she relaesed her third album, ''Mafia Caffe''. Song ''Džukelo'', the lead single from the album, became hit with the album release. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Ana+Nikoli%C4%87\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
