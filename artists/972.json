By 16, he was a resident at the local Solar night and by 17, had produced and released his first 12\" single. All of this, Dave accomplished before graduating from the University of Michigan's prestigious business school. Dave toured the world many times over as a DJ and was famous for his turntable dexterity and multi-genre sets. Dave was also integral in starting the Ghostly International label and co-produced the debut single, Hands Up For Detroit. \n\nDave moved to New York City, with the goal of producing beats for major Hip-Hop artists, resulting in a string of high-profile productions and remixes, including the song \"Ski Mask Way\" for 50 Cent, which was considered a critic and fan favorite and arguably the album's best. He was profiled in magazines such as XXL and Scratch as an up-and-coming producer. His passion led him to Brazil where he began producing new Hip-Hop artists, looking to shed light on the local scene. \n\nOn Tuesday, January 23rd 2007, Dave took his life at the age of 26, ending a long and difficult bout with depression and bipolar disorder.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Disco+D\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
