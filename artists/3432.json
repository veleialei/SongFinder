Surrounded by their vintage equipment, this talented four-piece band records slices of perfect, radio-friendly guitar-pop, psychedelic enough to appeal to record junkies and Sixties-retro fans, but edgy enough to fit into a modern rock set.\n\nStrange Change Machine, the new Grip Weeds double CD/LP, is a 24-song tour de force that sees the band perfecting their classic sound while also diving into uncharted musical territory. While the debate regarding the validity of the double album continues, the format has allowed the Grip Weeds to deliver the boldest recording of their career with their fifth full length release. Strange Change Machine was written and recorded while the band was ensconced in reissue projects (2007’s reworking of their debut House Of Vibes Revisited, and the 2008 Little Steven Van Zandt-sponsored compilation Infinite Soul: The Best Of The Grip Weeds) and outside studio production jobs (Singer/Drummer Kurt Reil recorded three albums with the legendary Smithereens, as well as three solo projects by Smithereens lead singer Pat Dinizio, among his other studio work).\n\nRestoring belief in guitar rock, guitarists Kristin Pinell and Rick Reil turn in career-defining performances, while drummer Kurt Reil's controlled chaos is the perfect foil for Michael Kelly's aggressive yet melodic bass work. The other major weapon in The Grip Weeds utility belt is their vocal harmonies. Whether the band is belting out intergalactic rock ('Speed Of Life'), a lilting west coast groove ('Be Here Now') or a folk ballad that fuses the Peter Green and Lindsey Buckingham eras of Fleetwood Mac ('Mistress Forest'), the vocal harmonies add an emotional depth to the already warm tones and catchy hooks. Whether it’s the brutal Garage Rock of 'Don't You Believe It', the Manchester Beat tale of a bridge jumper 'Mr. X', or acoustic guitar/flute instrumental 'Love In Transition', the band deftly jumps from style to style without losing their identity or giving the listener whiplash. The Grip Weeds have also reinvented the Todd Rundgren classic 'Hello It's Me'. While the original is a much-loved 1970s classic, The Grip Weeds replace the song's slicker elements with Nuggets-style grit.\n\nMeanwhile, The Grip Weeds lead the D.I.Y./indie rebellion on Strange Change Machine with every inch of this album- from the writing and performing down to the recording, engineering and artwork - created by The Grip Weeds and The Grip Weeds alone. With Strange Change Machine, The Grip Weeds have aimed their vision for rock and roll beyond the reach of the telescopes, so grab hold and enjoy the ride.\n\n\"We like to mix it up in Jersey and The Grip Weeds are a great example. A touch of John Lennon (and an appropriation of his character's name in \"How I Won The War\"), a bit of The Byrds, A dash of The Kinks, pinch of The Who, and a dallop of more muscular Zombies and you get something quite original actually. And quite cool.\" -Little Steven <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Grip+Weeds\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
