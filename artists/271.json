New singer Brian Howe, who had worked with Ted Nugent earlier, made 4 albums with the band. Year 1990`s LP Holy water contained big hit \"If you needed somebody\". Their style was then more like melodic rock. \n\nIn mid 1990`s Howe left the band and solo artist Robert Hart replaced him. Also other guitarist Dave Colwell & basist Rick Wills joined to group. In 2000`s Paul Rodgers came back to make the new album with old band members Kirke, Ralphs & other guys. They got a hit with the song \"Joe Fabulous\" what was number 1 on Classic Rock Radio.
