He was born as Josep Sergi Capdevila Querol on September 28, 1964 in Sabadell (near Barcelona).\n\nSergio Dalma started his career singing in bands and doing chorus, until he won the TV program \"Gent d'aqui\", in the Catalan station of TVE, which won him a regular contract to sing in the Shadows night-club in Barcelona. Sergio signed up with the record company Horus, and edited his first album, \"Esa chica es mia\", in 1989. Though it wasn't very successful, the company gave him another chance with \"Sintiéndonos la piel\", in 1991. That same year, Sergio Dalma was chosen to represent Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"Bailar Pegados\", where he finished in the 4th position. This was his call to fame.\n\nOne year later, he published \"Adivina\", which arrived to number one in charts thanks to the song \"Ave Lucía\". Afterwards, he signed with Polygram, with whom he edited four albums, and later with his current record company, Universal, with whom he has published another four.\n\nSergio Dalma has sung in Spanish for most of his career, but being born in Catalonia he speaks Catalan. His last two albums, \"Lo Mejor de Sergio Dalma\" and \"Todo Lo Que Quieres\", contain songs in Catalan. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sergio+Dalma\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
