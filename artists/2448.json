A sweetest selection that will make you laugh and it will make you sigh, and above all it will fill you with joy.\nTheir lyrics are about relationships and stories between P and his friends and acquaintances. Really, the lyrics are about this. Just check out song titles like \"Victor, fly me to Stafford\", \"You don't wanna be my girlfriend, Phoebe\" or \"Leo, are you still jumping out of windows in expensive clothes?\".\n\nTheir twee-pop sound shares the naïveté of the Sarah Records bands, the simple charms of CONFETTI and THE SOFTIES and the unaffected intonations of HEAVENLY's Amelia Fletcher. Sometimes, their sound tends more towards punk-pop à la HELEN LOVE (as in the short pill that is \"Gigi Leung is dead\"), and they also openly acknowledge their fondness for SLOWDIVE and MOJAVE 3, who might be a big influence on the final track, \"Dee, it may all end up tomorrow\". But, with a song titled \"When I listen to The Field Mice\", what else could they be but an indie band? <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/My+Little+Airport\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
