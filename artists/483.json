The band was originally fronted by lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist \"Dizzy\" Dean Davidson. They're best known for their eponymous debut album, which reached the #31 slot on the Billboard 200 top albums chart and included headbanging classics \"Girlschool\" and \"Long Way to Love\".\n\nThe band released a demo titled 'In America' in 1986, which journeyman drummer Tony Destra reportedly played on. Labeled sometimes as a sort of 'younger sister' of band Cinderella (\"whence they got their image, guitar player, and record contract\" as recounted by one critic), the quartet managed to break through in a big way. The band's self-titled debut album, released in 1988, was one of the most successful premieres of the 1988-89 season, selling more than one million copies and bringing more than 625,000 fans to their 130+ shows. They also won Metal Edge Magazine's 1988 Reader's Choice Award for Best New Band. Highlights of their early work include the top 40 rock hit \"Long Way to Love\" and the fan favorite \"Girlschool\".\n\nSadly, the band appeared saddled with the reputation of having peaked too early. After the release of the band's second album in 1989, titled 'Boys in Heat' and bringing in notable producer Neil Kernon, Davidson departed, and he formed the band Blackeyed Susan. Though appearing at first to be a fatal wound to the group, he was replaced by Las Vegas native Tommy Paris, who had a very similar vocal style. Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Zakk Wylde and Poison drummer Rikki Rockett guested on the band's third album, 'Bite Down Hard', which was released in 1991. However, the popularity of glam metal was on a decline around the time of the album's release due to the rising popularity of the 90s alternative movement. Britny Fox disbanded in 1992.\n\nAs referred to before, Michael Kelly Smith was previously in an early version of fellow Philadelphia glam metal band Cinderella until his dismissal, and later Tony Destra also played with them. Also, drummer Adam West, formerly of Tangier, played for Britny Fox briefly between the time of Tony Destra and Johnny Dee.\n\nBritny Fox reunited in 2001 with the same line-up before their disbandment, and they released a fourth studio album, called 'Springhead Motorshark', in 2003. While well-received by fans, the album picked up mixed critical reviews. The band had summer U.S. and European tours in 2007 and 2008. Guitarist Tommy Krash and drummer Henry Now joined at that time.\n\nAfter some infighting, Britny Fox reformed under original bassist Billy Childs. The other members were lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Jamie Fletcher, lead guitarist Greg Polcari, and drummer Henry Now. Heading into the rest of the 21st century, the future of the band appears uncertain.\n\nLine-Ups\n\n(1985–1987) Dean Davidson – lead vocals, rhythm guitar \nMichael Kelly Smith – lead guitar, backing vocals \nBilly Childs – bass, backing vocals \nTony Destra – drums, other percussion\n \n(1987) Dean Davidson – lead vocals, rhythm guitar \nMichael Kelly Smith – lead guitar, backing vocals \nBilly Childs – bass, backing vocals \nAdam West – drums, percussion \n \n(1987–1989) Dean Davidson – lead vocals, rhythm guitar \nMichael Kelly Smith – lead guitar, backing vocals \nBilly Childs – bass, keyboards, backing vocals \nJohnny Dee – drums, percussion, backing vocals \n \n(1990–2006) Tommy Paris – lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards \nMichael Kelly Smith – lead guitar, backing vocals \nBilly Childs – bass, backing vocals \nJohnny Dee – drums, percussion, backing vocals \n \n(2007) Tommy Paris – lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards \nGreg Polcari – lead guitar, backing vocals \nBilly Childs – bass, backing vocals \nHenry Now – drums, percussion, backing vocals \n \n(2008–present) Jamie Fletcher – lead vocals, rhythm guitar \nGreg Polcari – lead guitar, backing vocals \nBilly Childs – bass, backing vocals \nHenry Now – drums, percussion, backing vocals \n \nDiscography\n\n=Studio Albums=\nBritny Fox (1988) \nBoys in Heat (1989) \nBite Down Hard (1991) \nSpringhead Motorshark (2003) \n\n=Live Albums=\nLong Way to Live!
