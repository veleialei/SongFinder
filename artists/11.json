With guitarist/composer Jimmy Campbell as their leader, they went through a long (and musically credible) stint as the Kirkbys, before evolving into the 23rd Turnoff, embracing flower-power and psychedelia in the process. Their magnum opus was \"Michaelangelo,\" a gorgeous if somewhat downbeat single that should've fit right in with pieces like \"Nights in White Satin,\" among other melancholic hits. It didn't make the charts, and eventually the group split up and Campbell teamed up with Billy Kinsley to form Rockin' Horse. - Allmusic <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/23rd+Turnoff\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
