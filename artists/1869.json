Like Reagan, Kate Clinton has built her success upon breaking the rules. Her fast- paced, cutting edge performance skewers political egos and shreds taboos.\n\nKate Clinton, always an authority on Bush, sees comedy as a bawdy politic. The laughter she evokes is less a machinegun staccato outburst and more a rolling, building blend of fading fears and connections made. It's hard to be a dominatrix in a kinder, gentler nation, so Kate Clinton's comedy is more stand-with than stand-up, a witty yes in the land of no. Her popularity has been based on a fast-paced, satirical style which focuses on topical world concerns and an affirmative feminist agenda while drawing on her recovering Catholic roots and her years of high school English teaching.\n\nKate Clinton has emerged as a national force outside those traditionally male-dominated bastions, the comedy clubs. With four self-produced albums on her own WhysCrack label to her credit, Making Light (1982), Making Waves (1983), Live at the Great American Music Hall (1985), and Babes in Joyland (1991), Kate has built a wide following in her 10 years of performing professionally. ~ Laura Post, All Music Guide http://music.msn.com/music/artist-biography/kate-clinton/\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Clinton\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
