(In 2006, Mueller left the band \"to pursue graduate work in psychology\", and was replaced by their long-time friend Adam Bernstein.)\n\nIn 1992, she began to perform as a professional rock musician, playing in an all-female cover band called Lois Lane. When she started a band that played original music, Red Onion (Berkner, Brian Mueller, Adam Bernstein and Alan Lerner), she found song-writing to be a struggle--a problem that disappeared when she started writing children's music. \"Writing music for kids has not been a struggle at all,\" Berkner has said. \"The more I started working on material for children, the more I realized that it opened up creativity in me that I never knew I had.\"\n\nShe regularly appears on Noggin (with Lampert and Bernstein), a television network aimed at children, in music videos played between programs and on the program Jack's Big Music Show. Berkner has also appeared in Jamarama Live!, a touring music festival for children sponsored by Noggin, and in the 2006 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n\nIn 2004, Berkner and Mueller had a daughter, Lucy, and the Laurie Berkner Band cut back on performing. \"Daughter Lucy is her main audience now,\" her website noted. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Laurie+Berkner\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
