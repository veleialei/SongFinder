Boondox is the first rapper on the infamous Psychopathic Records label not to hail from a city environment - instead, according to label-mate Violent J, Boondox comes from \"the crops\".\n\nSome may remember Boondox more as the artist Turn Coat Dirty from the first round of the Underground Psychos Contest or even earlier as part of S.H.I (Southern Hustlas Inc.) with Smokey and Produk.\n\nThe Newton County native is easily identified by his distinct look - a flannel shirt, straw hat and sinister face paint. In addition to this, Boondox also sports the Hatchetman pendant typical of all artists on the Psychopathic Records label.\n\nAccording to his official biography, Boondox \"tears it up over everything from Southern sounding banjo and harmonica loops to (Mike E.) Clark's patented sick-ass drum beats and fat bass drops.\" Boondox's debut album, \"The Harvest\", was released on July 11, 2006 through Psychopathic Records and features the Axe Murder Boyz, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, the Insane Clown Posse and Twiztid as guests.\n\nWith hypeman Jake Polzin aka Cousin Cleetus by his side and a live drummer behind him, Boondox made his concert debut at the 2006 Gathering of the Juggalos, which consisted of 4 songs, \"Out Here\", \"Diggin' Myself Out\", \"Seven\", and \"They Pray With Snakes\".\n\nHe is currently accompanying Blaze Ya Dead Homie and the Axe Murder Boyz on \"The Tombstone Terror Tour\" which is Boondox's first ever tour on Psychopathic Records. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Boondox\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
