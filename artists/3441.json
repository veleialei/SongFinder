By 1962, Butler and the Brookses had departed, and after switching to ABC-Paramount Records, Mayfield, Gooden, and new Impression Fred Cash collectively became a top-selling soul act. Mayfield left the group for a solo career in 1970; Leroy Hutson, Ralph Johnson, Reggie Torian, and Nate Evans were among the replacements who joined Gooden and Cash before the group's demise in 1983.\n\nInductees into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, The Impressions are best known for their 1960s string of hits, many of which were heavily influenced by gospel music and served as inspirational anthems for the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nPersonnel:\nJerry Butler (1958 - 1960) \nCurtis Mayfield (1958 - 1970) \nSam Gooden (1958 - 1983) \nArthur Brooks (1958 - 1962) \nRichard Brooks (1958 - 1962) \nFred Cash (1960 - 1983) \nLeroy Hutson (1970 - 1973) \nRalph Johnson (1973 - 1976) \nNate Evans (1976 - 1979) \nReggie Torian (1973 - 1983) \n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n1963: The Impressions \n1964: Keep on Pushing \n1964: The Never Ending Impressions \n1965: One by One \n1965: People Get Ready \n1966: Ridin' High \n1967: The Fabulous Impressions \n1968: We're a Winner \n1968: This Is My Country \n1969: The Young Mods' Forgotten Story \n1969: The Versatile Impressions \n1969: Amen \n1970: Check out Your Mind! \n1972: Times Have Changed \n1973: Preacher Man \n1974: Finally Got Myself Together \n1974: Three the Hard Way \n1975: First Impressions \n1975: Sooner or Later \n1976: It's About Time \n1976: Originals \n1976: Loving Power \n1979: Come to My Party \n1981: Fan the Fire \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Impressions\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
