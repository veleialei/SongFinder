After forming on the fly in their tiny central Florida hometown, the group expanded into the scene in nearby Tallahassee. Listeners took a liking to their straightforward post-grunge growl, and Socialburn was soon a hit at local radio. By 2000, guitarist Chris Cobb had been added and a self-released CD had dropped. SB branched out with gigs in Jacksonville and Orlando, hoping to generate label interest in an area already buzzing with the success of Creed. Another self-released disc followed, and by 2002 Socialburn's work had paid off with a deal on Elektra. They debuted in February 2003 with Where You Are, a workmanlike slice of post-grunge hard rock heavily influenced by Nirvana. Extensive touring followed, with the band joining types like Blue October, Default, and Seether out on the road. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Socialburn\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
