Today they enjoy a cult like following, described by some as 'the world's most indie band' because- despite never having a manager, agent, or signing a formal record deal- they have toured the world and produced a sizable discography. Kurt Cobain notably listed them as a band he liked in his journals.\n\n Since the Cannanes' first release 'Bored Angry and Jealous' was named Single of the Year by UK music magazine NME in late 1986, the band has attracted an ever expanding international following (that is, one person who is getting increasingly fatter). Based in Sydney, Australia since 1984 the band has had a lengthy recording career and toured extensively in Australia and completed six tours of the USA.\n\nPrevious recordings have been financed by established labels in the USA & the UK and their nine CD/LP's 'Caveat Emptor', 'Witchety Pole', 'Short Poppy Syndrome', 'A Love Affair With Nature', 'The Cannanes', 'Arty Barbecue', 'Living The Dream', 'Communicating At An Unknown Rate' and 'Trouble Seemed So Far Away' as well as a whole bunch of increasingly collectable CD/EP's + 7'' & 12'' releases.\n\nMany releases have achieved widespread airplay, particularly on US College Radio hitting number one on numerous charts as well as appearances in CMJs' top 100. They have rated extensive mentions in SPIN Alternative Record Guide, Trouser Press Guide to 90's Rock, Virgin Encyclopedia of Indie & New Wave, The Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and in 1997 co-published with Woozy magazine their own autobiography 'Baby Take a Bow' in the UK.\n\nOver the years the band has also contributed to literally (count 'em) dozens of compilation projects released in many different countries. Those of which they are most proud are 'Fortune Cookie Prize' (which raised more than US$ 15,000 for Sasha Bruce Youthworks, a Washington DC homeless refuge, and more recently 'Indie Aid Abroad: A Little Help for East Timor', which raised over AUD$3000 for aid projects).\n\nRecent recordings have included collaborations with New York based loop wizard Explosion Robinson and from Leeds England Stewart Anderson (aka Steward) among others. A 3\" CD has just been released by New York DJ Douglas Wolk (WFMU), two new full length CDs nearing completion Nobody Loves An Albatross and This Is What It Sounds Like, a 'Best of so far' Pillars for posterity and other projects far too numerous to mention here.\n\nCURRENT LINEUP:\n\nStephen O'Neil [guitar]\nFrances Gibson [vocals, keyboard, flute]\nRichard King [drums, percussion, vocals]\nPenny McBride [trumpet, vocals]\nGavin Butler [bass]\nSexton Blake [detection]\nand when available: Greg Wadley [synth] and / or James Dutton [guitar]\n\nFor more information on The Cannanes (than you can shake a stick at!), email them at cannanes@cannanes.com. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Cannanes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
