Prior to the \"Parade\" sessions, Prince recorded various jazz-funk material with Eric Leeds, Sheila E., Levi Seacer Jr. and Wendy & Lisa, which was to be released under the name The Flesh, on an eponymous album, though Prince abandoned the project when he started working on \"Parade\", and the songs remain unreleased. The Flesh could be seen as a precursor to Prince's later jazz band Madhouse, featuring Eric Leeds, Levi Seacer Jr. and Sheila E.\n\n3.
