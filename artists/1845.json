Their location allows them to pack sweaty basements and living rooms in both Calgary and Edmonton. The sound said basements are filled with is spasmodically fast, and incredibly pissed-off. Many songs clock in at under thirty seconds, with one-minute-plus songs being considered epic. These bursts are characterized by power-chord heavy riffage, impossibly fast blast beats and really refreshing song structuring. Kali’s tunes keep the audience/listeners on their toes, with many half-intros, fake-out builds ups, and equally as many satisfying thrash-outs and delivered breakdowns. Lyrics and merch are firmly based on animal rights, prejudice stemming from ignorance, and oppression of all kinds. The spectacle that is a Kali show has become mythical, with entire rooms crowding the Mic to yell along slogans of defiance in clenched-fist-rage.
