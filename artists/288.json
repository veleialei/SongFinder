Maybe that’s where the band draws inspiration for their music, or maybe their style is inspired by their name, or maybe it's just when these four band-mates come together the end result is always bold and impressive? \n\nWith a sound built upon a resolute sense of purpose and shaped by hundreds of explosive live shows, Baroness position themselves at the forefront of heavy music with their first full length and Relapse debut Red Album. Red Album is at once powerful, expressive, confident, and commanding. The record sees the band expand its sonic vision; colossal riffs and haunting vocals roll like thunder across epic songs spanning both the intense and the sublime. As with each Baroness recording, Red Album was recorded at the Jam Room Studio in Columbia, SC w/ producer Phillip Cope and engineers Jay Matheson and Steve Slavich. \n\nIn 2009, the Blue Record was released by Relapse Records. With this release, they continued to push the envelope and development as their style progresses. This progression ultimately gave them the Album of the Year award from Decibel Magazine and gave them numerous Best of lists from Pitchfork, Village Voice, Popmatters, Revolver, Rock Sound, and Metal Hammer.\n\nBaroness hadn't toured for the entire year in 2011 to focus on creating a new, both in the sense of music and in the literal meaning, album. Yellow-Green was recorded with producer John Congleton in Hoboken, NJ and Dallas, TX. The new album will be released on July 17th, followed by extensive touring.\n\nBARONESS has forged forward with heavy independent touring -almost 250 shows a year - since the band’s inception. They've criss-crossed the U.S. three times, Europe, and the UK twice, and have performed at international music festivals such as SXSW, MacRock, ZXZW in The Netherlands, Australia's Soundwave Festival and more. Baroness has toured with many friends and peers, including Mastodon, MUNICIPAL WASTE, TORCHE, KYLESA, ALABAMA THUNDERPUSSY, CURSED, THE HOLY MOUNTAIN, and many more. \n\nBaroness is: \nAllen Blickle- drums\nMatt Maggioni – bass\nJohn Baizley – guitars, vocals\nPeter Adams – guitars\n\nDiscography\n2004 First \t\t\t\t\t            (Hyperrealist Records) \n2005 Second \t\t\t\t\t    (Hyperrealist Records)\n2007 A Grey Sigh in a Flower Husk     (At a Loss Recordings)\n(aka: Third), split CD with Unpersons \n2007 Red Album \t\t\t\t            (Relapse Records) \n2009 Blue Record \t\t\t\t    (Relapse Records)\n2012 Yellow & Green                              (Relapse Records)\n2015 Purple                                              (Abraxan Hymns)\n\nWebsite\nwww.myspace.com/yourbaroness\nwww.baronessmusic.com/\nbaroness.bandcamp.com/\nwww.facebook.com/YourBaroness\n\nhttp://eepurl.com/mSy-b\nSign up for the Relapse Records newsletter to stay up to date on all the latest Baroness news, tour dates and merch! <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Baroness\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
