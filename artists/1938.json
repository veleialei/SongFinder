Perhaps this is the case with  Koordinate of Wonders. The original name of the band is in Russian Координаты Чудес, named after a short story by science fiction writer, Robert Sheckley. \n\nKoW is a two person project with Yuri creating most of the music and Anton focused on promotion. They first started their music making experiments together back in 1998. The results were and still are highly melodic and tending toward the IDM flavour.\n\nKoordinate of Wonders have played together with some of Russia’s top electronic acts including EU and Klutch. Labels taking notice of Koordinate of Wonders include Gizmo Lab (Belarus), SHUM (Russia), Toytronic (UK) and a netlabel Please Do Something (US). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Koordinate+Of+Wonders\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
