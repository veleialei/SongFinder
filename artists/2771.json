A trio and three songs with a fresh outlook. A mix of indie, synth-pop and musical jiggery-pokery shaken with a good dose of the eighties. The trio certainly has a lot to offer - the music from these twenty-year-old Dusseldorfers is perfectly balanced at todayʼs cutting edge. Rated by the press, adored by fans, the boys thrive on digging out old sounds to enrich their latest ideas.\nIn their 3 years theyʼve played over 150 concerts all over Germany and supported the likes of The Kilians, Jennifer Rostock, The Robocop Kraus, Herrenmagazin, One Fine Day, Fire In The Attic, The Ettes & The Kills. Festivals have seen them share the stage with Turbostaat, Eternal Tango, Get Well Soon & Digitalism.\nThe EP was recorded in Tresorfabrik Studios in Düsseldorf and Kottenstudio in Dortmund. Mixing and mastering duties were performed by Glen Nicholls in London, whose previous charges include Snow Patrol, Rihanna, Depeche Mode and White Lies. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Punk%27d+Royal\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
