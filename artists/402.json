With the screaming vocals of Mike Blank and the barbed-wire sounds of Renee Wasted's electric guitar soaring over the slamming rhythms of bassist Timm \"T. J.\" Blank and drummer Chad 10 Seconds, the New Jersey-based band create a supersonic, anything goes, punk-inspired, sound of their own. According to \"The CMJ-NMR Review\", Blanks 77 \"specialize in the pure punk style of '77 but with no socio-political agenda\".\n\nBlanks 77 was conceived by vocalist Mike Blank and drummer Chad 10 Seconds during jam sessions at rock club, The Pipeline. Guitarist Renee Wasted was added after she replied to an ad placed in a local music newspaper. Blanks 77 has gone through three bass players since its inception. Original bassist Brendan, who had previously played with the Connecticut-based group, Devestation, was replaced by Geoff, who gave way to Timm \"T.J.\" Blank, formerly the lead singer and guitarist for The Broken Heroes, in 1995.\n\nBlanks 77's debut album, \"Killer Blanks\", was released in Germany in 1995 and in the United States the following year. Their second album, \"Tanked And Pogoed\", followed in 1997. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Blanks+77\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
