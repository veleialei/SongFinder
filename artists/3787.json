Their hits included Edge of a Broken Heart, Cryin', How Much Love and Love is a Killer. The band split at the height of their success, following their second release, Rev It Up due to creative differences with regards to songwriting and the band's musical direction. There was a third studio album in '98 entitle Tangerine although this was released by only Janet Gardner and Roxy Petrucci with the help of some unknown players and against the wishes of Vixen founder and copyright owner Jan Kuehnemund. The result was a rather protracted legal battle. \n\nAfter some ill-fated reunions for various tours and projects, Vixen is back with a now stable line-up and touring again. They have just released a new disc in fall of 2006 called Live and Learn. The current members are Jan Keuhnemund on guitar, Lynn Louise Lowrey on bass, Kat Kraft on drums, and Jenna Sanz-Agero on vocals. The new album was produced by Dennis MacKay who produced the bands debut in the late 80's.\n\n2) Vixen was also a female-fronted hard rock band from the early 80's, though the rest of the band was male. Most notably, ex-Megadeth guitarist Marty Friedman was in this band. A 2004 2-disc compilation entitled The Works includes essentially everything recorded by this band.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Vixen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
