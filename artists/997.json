Don is not only gifted with such a ‘sweet’ singing voice, but has other talents as a rhythm guitarist, drummer, bassist and also experiments on the piano to produce and arrange tracks. \n\nDon has a very charming personality and his musical abilities have given him privileges at an early age of working alongside some of the greatest artists such as Paul Young, Dennis Brown, ABC, John Holt, Maxi Priest and many others. Don has even supported international artists like SWV, Massive Attack, Lisa Stansfield, and Wet Wet Wet. \n\nIn 1993 Don collaborated with Trevor T of Juggling Records and came with the huge Reggae hit ‘See it in your eyes’. This held the number 1 position in almost every Reggae chart for 12 weeks. ‘Lovers Do’, his follow up single entered the then Echoes Chart at number 9. \n\nDon’s first album titled ‘Don Campbell, The Album’ was released in May 1994 and is still selling internationally and can still be found amongst most Reggae Lovers Collections. 1994 saw Don at the British Reggae Industry Award where he picked up 4 Awards for ‘Best New Comer’, ‘Best Male Vocalist’, ‘Best Singer’ and ‘Best Songwriter’. The Echoes paper described Don as ‘The most exciting UK Reggae Vocalist to emerge’. In 1995 at the Black Music Awards, Don walked away with Awards for ‘Best Reggae Soloist’ and ‘Best Reggae Single’. \n\nIn 1996 Don collaborated with General Saint, landing a number 1 spot in South East Asia with the cover of 60’s singer Neil Sedaka’s song ‘Oh Carol’ which was internationally a huge success. \n\nAfter extensive touring all around Europe, South East Asia, Africa, America, Australia and Canada, Don returns in 1999 with an album called Reggae Max. Don went on to doing three more exciting albums between 2002 and 2004. \n\n2005 sees the birth of ‘Blu Jeanz Records’ and ‘Camm Street Publishing’ owned by Directors Don Campbell and General Saint who have two rising stars signed to the Company - so look out for the whole new package, don’t say you have not been warned. \n\nDon still continues to tour around Europe and England and is one of the UK’s most sought after Reggae Artists. \n\nThe final word from Don is ‘Even better things yet to come’.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Don+Campbell\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
