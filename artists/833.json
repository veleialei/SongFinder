themselves Spencer Tracy before settling on Danny Wilson - after Frank Sinatra's character in the movie Meet Danny Wilson...\n\nTheir debut single on Virgin Records in Feb' 1987, \"Mary's Prayer\", failed to make an impression, although it did chart in the US before hitting the UK Top 50 in August and then No. 3 the following March.  The song was later featured in the movie \"Something About Mary\"\n\nThe debut album \"Meet Danny Wilson\" was full of promise with the band's clean-cut image fitting perfectly in the late-80's trend for slick.\n\nTheir follow-up album, \"Bebop Moptop\", however, failed to make much impression, though the fine single \"The Second Summer Of Love\" did go Top 30.\n\nThere was also a subsequent \"Greatest Hits\" album released after the band split in 1990. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Wilson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
