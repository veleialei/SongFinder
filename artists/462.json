The group later moved to Brooklyn, New York, and then to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where they are currently located.\n\nBottom of the Hudson is the brainchild is singer/songwriter/guitarist Eli Simon, who released the debut album, The Omaha Record, in 2003. Simon played all the instruments on the album, and had a hand in mixing it. The band's latest release, the 6-song EP Holiday Machine, saw the addition of Justin Stile on bass, Chris Coella on drums and Matt Mitchell on guitar.\n\nThe band recently suffered major tragedy when they were involved in a serious van wreck on Sunday July 29th 2007, while returning home after the final date of a short East Coast tour to promote their new album. While on I-40 near Clinton, NC, a tire blew out sending their van out of control and flipping it multiple times. Bassist Trevor Butler was killed in the accident and drummer Greg Lytle was hospitalised after fracturing his skull. The other members of the band, Eli Simon, Michael Prince and William Chesterton Chambers, suffered minor injuries and were released from hospital. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bottom+of+the+Hudson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
