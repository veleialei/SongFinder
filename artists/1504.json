They continued their work with Jefferson Airplane during this project, and even though Jefferson Airplane dissolved, Hot Tuna has continued to tour to this day.  Casady is considered by many to be one of the most advanced and innovative in his style.\n\nTheir official website is http://hottuna.com and http://hottunatunes.com has music downloads of some of their recent live dates and a few older dates which really capture the spirit of these two very talented musicians.\n\nJoey Covington, a self-taught drummer since the age of 10, (also know in his childhood as Joey Michno) helped found Blues-rock group Hot Tuna in 1969, alongside Jefferson Airplane members Jack Casady and Jorma Kaukonen, while the latter band was still in its beginnings.\nHowever, the recordings he did for Tuna were unreleased and eventually rejoined Casady and Kaukonen at the Airplane and featured on three studio albums, the first being Volunteers, as he replaced Spencer Dryden midway through the recording process. He wrote and sang the last hit for Jefferson Airplane 1971's \"Pretty As You Feel\" featured on the Bark Album.\nCovington left Jefferson Airplane in mid-1972 to pursue a solo career, starting with Fat Fandango.[3] He subsequently faded from view, only resurfacing sporadically, like in 1976's Spitfire by Jefferson Starship, where he co-wrote the hit single \"With Your Love\".\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s he toured with various configurations as The San Francisco Allstars.\nCovington was well-known around the Palm Springs area as a talented musician who delighted his audience by playing free gigs whenever possible. His last performance was for a Marilyn Monroe celebration in Palm Springs June 1, 2013. Covington thrilled his audience and signed autographs following the performance.[4]\nCovington was killed in an automobile accident in Palm Springs, California on June 4, 2013. Covington slammed into a wall and was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the collison. He was 67.[5]\n\nSee also: Hot Tuna at Wikipedia <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Hot+Tuna\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
