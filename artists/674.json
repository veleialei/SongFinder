Cinder (BCN) MySpace\n\n\n============================\n\n1) Cinder formed in 1999 with singer Roger Young, and lead guitarist Kenny Craig, playing in bars and clubs around the Southern Florida coastline area and writing songs for an album that would be called 'Soapy Tuna'. It was at this time they picked up bassist Pat McGuire, and drummer Brian Colbert, and changed their name to 'Jesus Gun'. In this form they recorded another album, which was available only at shows. \n\nIn 2001 they signed a record deal with Geffen Records and an album 'Break Your Silence' was recorded, with Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver producing nine of the albumâ€™s eleven tracks. In addition, Jay Baumgartner (Papa Roach, Alien Ant Farm, and Drowning Pool) and John Kurzweg (Creed, Puddle of Mudd) lent a hand in the production process as well. After the album was finished, the bands name was changed again, this time to 'Cinder', due to pressure from the record company (for legal reasons). Cinder began touring with such heavyweights as Creed and Sevendust, gaining a loyal following across America. Unfortunately, before the release date Geffen Records was bought out and unsigned bands including Cinder were released, and the album never was released. The single from that album \"Soul Creation\" was released and received much airtime on both the radio and on MTV, essentially promoting an album that was doomed to never exist (though a promo copy of the album did indeed leak onto the internet in 2002). Soul Creation even managed to get onto The Big Billboard 200 which is a dream for any band. Soul Creation was also featured in PS2 video games 'MX Unleashed' and 'NHL 2004'. This single helped keep the band's dreams alive as they struggled with their record company's contract. It took two more years for Cinder to be released from their contract with Geffen Records, and two more years after that before they were picked up by Rock Ridge Records.\n\nIn this time of limbo bassist Pat McGuire decided to leave the band, he was soon replaced with their current bassist, Steve Reich. With the new lineup and the new record company Cinder was ready to get back to recording. Their second album, titled House Full Of No Trust, was released on August 8, 2006, and a tour was to follow that but it was cut short due to lack of funds and Rock Ridge Records dropping the band. The album had a much softer sound than their unreleased first album. A third album entitled 'You' which saw the band returning to their original, heavier style was released in 2010. The album contains a total of 7 songs: 4 new songs and 2 new recordings of songs from their unreleased Geffen album. The lead single 'Gangsta Stereo' was released in 2010 and failed to chart.\n\n2) Cinder was a hardcore band from Barcelona ( http://www.myspace.com/cinderkids ) that lasted from 2001 to 2010. They released a full-length album and a couple splits and 7''. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cinder\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
