They charged forward with high expectations from Electra, but sadly the horned beast thundered into the wilderness eventually falling prey to the carrion of overindulgence. In the late sixties Electra producer Paul Rothchild whose credits include Love’s Forever Changes and the Doors’ Strange Days had self-manipulated this manufactured supergroup which was signed up in 1968. Its understandable that big things were expected from a classically trained keyboardist from Jon Lee & The Checkmates called Michael Fonfara (keyboards) ex- Electric Flag, Billy Mundi (drums) ex- Mothers of Invention, Doug Hastings (guitar) ex- Daily Flash & Buffalo Springfield, Danny Weis (guitar) ex- Iron Butterfly- Jerry Penrod (bass) and John Finlay (vocals). The spectacular foldout cover with artwork by G. Sazaferin depicting a brightly colourful beaded Rhinoceros had all the qualifications for superstar status. In hindsight the beast was more electric soul apart from the surging instrumental “Apricot Brandy”, which was later adopted as a Radio One Theme for the BBC. A certain amount of acknowledgement has to be given to the Little Richard classic “You’re My Girl (I don’t want to discuss it)” which was covered superbly by Delaney & Bonnie on their live tour with Eric Clapton and a brassy version of Larry Williams’ “I Need Love”. The bluesey takes on Alan Gerber’s “When You Say You Sorry”, the laidback “Same Old Way” and “I Will Serenade You” later covered by Three Dog Night were great once listened to over and over, but lacked impact. The album did however initiate heavy body drumming by the strong armed Billy Mundi way before the Zep’s John Bonham but closer to Vanilla Fudge. The follow up albums Satin Chicken and Better Times Coming now devoid of Penrod failed to make the grade with Mundi, Gerber and Hastings departing. Fonfara featured extensively on numerous Lou Reed recordings.\n\n2) Rhinoceros, aka British multi-instrumentalist, producer and remixer David Picking (also a member of Gramophone, and occasional collaborator with cult UK band No-Man).\nDavid's music combines the creaking lo-fi atmospherics of Papa M and the eccentric ambience of Brian Eno with the cut-and-paste aesthetics of DJ Shadow. The result, also featuring the evocative croon of No-Man vocalist Tim Bowness, and the turntable skills of DJ Log from UK hip-hop crew Michaelis Constant, is a quiet gem of reflective, organic electronica. 'Tiny Ghosts' was his debut CD release.\n\n3) Immovable, skin like armor...a rolling juggernaut. Rhinoceros, Buffalo's sxe monster could NOT be more aptly named. Having had a comprehensive west coast tour under their belts at a stage when most young bands are more inclined to play to their own scene; Rhinoceros is a force unto themselves. Sonically and stylistically nothing short of pulverizing. There is no need for Rhinoceros to carve out a small niche for themselves within straightedge hardcore, or the broader scene of hardcore because Rhinoceros is going to change the nature of the game. Stylistically, reminiscent of early Madball with touches of 100 Demons; Rhinoceros does not fall into the trap of just borrowing from their influences, but rather etching out their own place within hc and sxe. Their debut full-length, is imminent..much like the chaos that will follow.\n\n4) Rhinoceros was a hardcore punk band from the Netherlands, active in the 1980's.\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rhinoceros\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
