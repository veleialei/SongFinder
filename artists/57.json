D'Angelo LaGrone was born in Memphis on August 3rd, 1988. Raised in the southside of Chicago since he was two, he was introduced to many styles of music from his family. Indie rock, reggae, gospel, trance, techno, ska, any other genre's well out of the average 3-year old's range. Around 6 was when he found hip-hop himself.\n\nIn 8th grade, D'Angelo decided to give freestyle rapping a try. Already dutifuly influenced by music, he began to create rhymes out of thin air with ease. Seeing as he had nothing to lose, he began to write raps for his close friends, putting them on voicemails & other ways they could save him. By the time he was 14, he had his first official rap notebook.\n\nLiving on the southside of Chicago brought to D'Angelo friends with the same type of passion for music. One Akeem Williamson began producing at the age of 14, and the two began rapping for fun & skill growth. It wasn't until D'Angelo's life took a stressful turn for the worse that he realized that his skill could get him somewhere in life.\n\nBy his senior year in high school, D'Angelo was known around as \"Ace\", a rapper and producer {in training}. His first mixtape, \"Royal Flush\", was formed with a hybrid of industry instrumentals & beats produced by Ace & Akeem, now named Slitta Boi. By the time Ace arrived in college, he had his heart set on a full-on rap career.\n\nNo longer calling himself a rapper, but an mc/lyricist, Ace took every thing about his craft seriously. He said \"I treat life as if I'm an artist\". Keeping the line in his heart, he decided to pick up the moniker \"da Vinci\" to represent how his music is a work of art.\n\nNow 19, in the studio producing, engineering, writing, and mastering his long-awaited ep, Prospect for the Blind, Ace da Vinci plans on showing the world a form of lyricism not exhibited by today's generic rap music. He displays emotion, charisma, determination, inspiration, & most of all, creativity and ingenuinity. Plans of unveiling his own label, SmartMouf ent. & with his fiance', StarChasers Enterprises, a slate dedicated to the liberal arts {inquire for details on how to become affiliated}, Ace da Vinci has no desire to stop until you all remember his name.\n\n'Til then, stay tuned.\n\nHead up, chest out, rock steady. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ace+Da+Vinci\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
