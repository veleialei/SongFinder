Georges Delerue was a Commander of Arts and Letters, one of France's highest honours.\n\nHis career was diverse and he composed frequently for major avant-garde directors, most often François Truffaut, but also for Jean-Luc Godard's film Contempt, and for Alain Resnais, Louis Malle, and Bernardo Bertolucci, besides working on several Hollywood productions.\n\nHe composed the music for Flemming Flindt's ballet, Enetime (The Lesson), based on Ionesco's play, La Leçon. During his 42 years career he put his talent to the service of nearly 200 feature movies, 125 short ones, 70 TV films and 35 TV serials. According to many testimonies he would do and redo some cues to fit the new editing of a sequence without any protestation. He insisted to be allowed to orchestrate and conduct himself in order to polish every detail. Georges Delerue was extraordinarily gifted for melody and at creating surrounding overtones which encapsulated the spirit of the movies for which he collaborated, enhancing them often beyond the expectations of their directors. He's a true giant among giants.\n\nGeorges Delerue died from a heart attack at the age of 67, just after the recording of the last cue for the soundtrack to Rich In Love. He is buried in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Georges+Delerue\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
