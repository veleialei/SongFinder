Hucknall (also known as \"Mick 'Red' Hucknall\") is the lead singer of British band Simply Red.\n\nHucknall was born in St Mary's Hospital, Manchester, the son of Reg and Maureen Hucknall. Hucknall's mother left the family when Hucknall was 3. He and his father lived very briefly in Bredbury before settling in Denton, where he grew up. Hucknall attended Audenshaw Grammar School for Boys.\n\nHucknall claims to have been among the people present at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester in June of 1976, where the Sex Pistols were playing. His interest in the music scene led to the launch of his career in the late seventies, when he was part of the formation of the band Frantic Elevators.\n\nThe Frantic Elevators released four singles, including a version of \"Holding Back The Years\", which he would later record with Simply Red.\n\nAs lead singer and core member of Simply Red, he has become the identifiable face of the band. His face, including his long curly red hair, was featured prominently on album artwork and in videos.\n\nHucknall is also one of the founders and financial backers of the successful reggae label Blood and Fire. He also manages the record label \"simplyred.com\".\n\nHucknall is active in politics, and is a prominent celebrity supporter of the UK Labour Party and is a close friend of British Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nIt has been claimed Hucknall's resentment for former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is evident in three of Simply Red's songs; \"She'll Have To Go\" on the Simply Red album A New Flame, Your Mirror and Wonderland on the Stars album.\n\nFollowing the Asian Tsunami, Hucknall made a public statement of support for the charity SOS Children and asked his fans to consider following his lead by supporting the charity.\n\nDuring much of the 1980s and 1990s, Hucknall gained a reputation as a ladies' man. A Daily Mail article indicated that he had dated Catherine Zeta-Jones, Helena Christensen, and a number of other models, actresses and dancers in the UK.\n\nHe and partner Gabriella Wesberry had a baby daughter, Romy True Hucknall, together in June 2007. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mick+Hucknall\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
