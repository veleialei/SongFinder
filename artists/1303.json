Blaze initially took to music as a hobby while studying Business Administration at Albany State, but the pull of his destiny called to him through the influence of musical mentors such as Buju Banton, Capleton, and Fred Locks. Fred Locks provided his entry into the music industry with Light Up the Lighter and Kings of Kings, his first two recordings. The songs were well received, and a memorable stage performance in 2000 led all who witnessed the event to christen the young artist FYAH BLAZE. \n\nBlaze also takes his position as a role model to young people very seriously. He maintains an open door policy for the youth of his community. He wants to show them that anyone who believes in himself can reach any goal if they use the steps of faith and education. Fyah Blaze has just completed work on his first album in January 2005 with artist/producer YahBreeze and the rest of the All Arc production team. His desire to use music to spread love and knowledge make him a perfect vehicle for the All Arc writing style. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fyah+Blaze\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
