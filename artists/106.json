After the band's breakup, he continued to collaborate with Crécy & Air, on subsequent projects. Gopher made a name for himself with \"You, My Baby & I\", an album that combined elements of funk, house & electronica. Before the album's release, Gopher had created his own label, Solid.\n\nThe follow-up came out in 2001. Asked by designer Yves St. Laurent for three tracks for their Yves' Cakewalk show, Alex ended up composing ten tracks. He then asked French underground artist, Demon, to give the music a more \"clubbier\" feeling. The end result was a critically acclaimed album titled Wuz, which used elements found in \"You, My Baby, and I\" but had its own distinct sound.\n\nAlex Gopher continues to produce original tracks for Solid. He did release an EP titled \"I Need Change\" for BTK Records.\n\nHe also continues to tour in Spain, Italy, Australia, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, the UK and Brazil.\n\nSites: En.Wikipedia <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Alex+Gopher\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
