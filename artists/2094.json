It’s that experience and presence well beyond his years that has seen him become one of this country’s leading Blues artists and most respected guitarists. His incredible command of the guitar, powerful voice and high energy performance captivates any audience.\n\nIn between extensive touring within Australia, Lloyd has travelled all over the world with frequent tours to Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.S.A, where he’s toured coast to coast 6 times. During these tours he has performed at some of the world’s best known Blues venues and largest festivals as well as showcasing at every major international guitar player’s event in the world.\n\nHe’s played bills with legendary Blues artists from Buddy Guy and Etta James to Ray Charles, as well as artists from a range of musical genres including Bob Dylan, Peter Frampton and Willie Nelson.\n\nIn 2006, Lloyd found a great deal of success in Japan. A DVD recorded live to a sold out Tokyo Disneyland has become a ‘must have’ for guitar fans in Asia and sparked the interest of the Japanese mainstream. He is now performing on Japan’s commercial television and radio as well as appearing on the cover of countless magazines.\n\nDuring his time in the U.S.A, he was invited to teach and lecture for the prestigious “Blues In The schools” program. This nation-wide project is designed to teach American youth about the tradition of Blues within their culture and also supplies lessons and instruments to students who otherwise couldn’t afford to have music in their lives.\n\nIntroducing tomorrow’s musicians to the Blues is something Lloyd is very passionate about and he now works closely with many of Australia’s young artists to give back some of what he got from the Blues music scene as a teenager. Popular Blues/Roots artists like Kim Churchill, Jason Lowe and Jonno Zilber have gone on to be award-winning artists and count Lloyd as a major inspiration and mentor.\n\nFor the past 8 years, Lloyd has been the premier endorsee for Cole Clark guitars. The company is a leader in guitar technology with a world-wide distribution and CEO Brad Clark has even modelled much of his company instrument’s evolution on what Lloyd needed for his sound. He is an integral part of the company’s success and is their preferred player for demonstrations and trade fairs.\n\nWhile fans and critics have always focused on his guitar skills, Lloyd has come of age as a composer and lyricist. His 2005 release, “Tall Stories” was quickly recognized as a breakthrough recording for him and proves him to be an integral part of Australia’s ever-changing Blues music style. The follow-up, “Timber & Steel” was an entirely solo affair that mixed his considerable song-writing skills together with his exceptional acoustic guitar expertise.\n\nThe current release, “Tangled Brew” is an original CD that serves as both the result of a lifetime of touring and as a clear shift towards new sounds within the genre.\n\nRecorded with Malaysian percussionist Arunachala, and experimenting with Cole Clark’s latest technology, “Tangled Brew” re-invents Lloyd’s raw, hard hitting style for the masses and still maintains his connection to the music he loves.\n\nDarcy Mansfield once a lover of Lloyd, now just sleeps with monkeys for bananas.... <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lloyd+Spiegel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
