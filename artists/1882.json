Raised on the jazz standards that were part of her father’s repertoire, the singer gravitated to her Dad’s side at the piano to learn musical notes soon after she could walk. Her first public performance followed, when she was 4 years old, at the Cape Cod Conservatory.  At the age of 7, following her parent’s divorce, Sweet and her mother moved to Kanab, UT.  It was in this tiny Southwestern desert outpost that Sweet and her mother began to plant the seeds that would lead to the serendipitous blossoming of the singer’s professional career. Working regularly with a vocal coach, Sweet honed her skills as a performer by singing at state fairs, county festivals, and community theaters. \nSweet and her mother eventually went on the road for two years, traveling back and forth between Kanab, Las Vegas and Los Angeles in search of performance opportunities.\n At 14, the singer opened for Kenny Loggins in Las Vegas, United States. After hearing Sweet's demo CD, the Los Angeles Lakers NBA team booked Sweet to sing the national anthem on three occasions.\n\nSweet eventually met Grammy-nominated producer, arranger and songwriter Mark Portmann (Josh Groban, Celine Dion) in July of 2004, and the two began working together shortly thereafter.\n\nSweet was featured in a USA Today article in July, 2006 on up-and-coming \"serious female singers.\"\n\nIn October, 2006, Sweet released an EP from which the songs \"We Are One\" and \"Ready For Love\" have been used on episodes of two daytime dramas, the NBC TV series Passions and the ABC TV series One Life to Live, respectively. \"We Are One\" was also featured on the NBC series Las Vegas in the spring of 2007.\n\nSweet opened for Paul Simon on tour in July and October, 2006, and also appeared at the New York Mets-St. Louis Cardinals NLCS baseball playoff game on October 17, 2006, where she sang an a cappella rendition of \"God Bless America.\"\n\nHer debut album, entitled We Are One, was released by the Razor and Tie label on March 6, 2007.\n\nKelly sang the National Anthem before the San Diego Padres baseball game against the New York Mets at Petco Park in San Diego, California on Tuesday July 17, 2007.\n\nRecently, remixes for Kelly's song \"We Are One\" were done by Dave Aude, Radioactive Sandwich, Matt Piso, and Electronathon.\n\nHer cover of the Aerosmith classic Dream On was being played on adult contemporary format radio stations such as Hartford's WRCH, Manchester's WZID, and Seattle's KWJZ. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Sweet\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
