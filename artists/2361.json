Brian started making music somewhere after his parents' divorce in 1997. He played multiple instruments in a number of different bands and projects, teaching himself how to play guitar, drums, bass and keyboard without the aid of classical training. In 2001, Brian began dabbling in psychedelic and ambient music, and by 2002 he became interested in writing computer-produced (but still organic) songs. Doing simple recordings with a four-track, guitar, organ and a drum machine, he adopted the Parallax moniker and slowly progressed into a unique and expressive aesthetic for himself. By May of 2004, Brian had completed 6 albums under the Parallax name before retiring it and releasing music as Milieu. Brian currently lives with his wife Sophia and their pets.\nOfficial site \n\n\n2) Milieu is a band from Tipton, IN. http://www.myspace.com/milieuband\n\n3) Milieu is a techno artist from Detroit, MI.\nhttp://www.myspace.com/atmosrecords <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Milieu\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
