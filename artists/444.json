Bobby often attended his father's concerts as a child. His sister is fellow singer Alma Pulido. His cousin is Allison Pulido.\n\n[edit] Music career\n\nVery proud of his Mexican heritage, Pulido released his first CD on September 15, 1995, commemorating Mexico's independence. By 1996, his songs were huge hits around Monterrey and the southern United States. Some of his early hits included the songs Te Voy a Amar as well as Desvelado. That year, he performed in front of over 60,000 fans at the Guadalupe Expo.\n\nOn November of 1996, his album Enseñame reached the top of the charts in Mexico's northern states. At the end of the year, he received the prestigious Cerro de la Villa award, as well as the Revelation of the Year award in Mexico.\n\nSubsequently, Pulido released three more albums, becoming an international superstar, conquering Hispanic fans in the United States, as well as fans in Costa Rica, Puerto Rico and many other Latin American countries. Pulido has earned many awards for his productions, and he has collaborated with such singers as Juan Gabriel, the Frijoles Romanticos, and others.\n\nHis current hit is a remake of one of his father's greatest hits, Obsesión. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+Pulido\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
