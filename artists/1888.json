Neal comes from a musical family and has often performed with his brothers in his band.\n\nNeal preserves the swamp blues sound of his native south Louisiana, as befits someone who learned from Slim Harpo, Buddy Guy and his father, the harmonica player, Raful Neal.\n\nIn 1987, Neal cut his debut album for the Florida record producer, Bob Greenlee â€” an updated swamp feast initially marketed on King Snake Records as Bio on the Bayou. Alligator Records picked it up the following year, retitled it  Big News from Baton Rouge!!.\n\nIn 1991 he also proved to be a talented actor in the Broadway production of the folk musical Mule Bone (by Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston), singing numbers written by Taj Mahal.\n\nNeal has played with blues stars including Lucky Peterson and Lazy Lester. He also co-composed music for the soundtrack to the 2003 film, Love, Sex and Eating the Bones.\n\nIn September 2006 Neal announced he was taking a year's break from recording and performing, due to an undisclosed illness. He returned to the public eye at the Monterey Blues Festival in June 2007.
