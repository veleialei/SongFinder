While the group took a brief hiatus, she released her first solo album, \"The Dutchess\", she was also featured in Slash's debut album \"Slash\" singing two rock songs \"Beautiful Dangerous (feat. Fergie)\" and \"Paradise City (feat. Cypress Hill & Fergie)\". The Feel Alive Songfacts states that she teamed up with Pitbull and DJ Poet for \"Feel Alive.\" It was the first new song from Fergie as a lead artist to be released since the deluxe edition of The Dutchess in 2008.\n\nIn the Summer of 2006. Her debut single titled London Bridge quickly shot up to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She later released Fergalicious, Glamorous, Big Girls Don't Cry and  Clumsy, all of which led on to become top 5 singles on the chart.\n\nAs a child, she appeared on the television program Kids Incorporated for several years with Renee Sands, who would become another member of Wild Orchid. Ferguson's well-scrubbed image on that show presents quite a contrast with the \"ghetto-funk\" image she has more recently begun to cultivate. Ferguson was the voice of Sally Brown in two Charlie Brown specials: It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown (1984), Snoopy's Getting Married, Charlie Brown (1985) and also voiced Sally in the 1985 version of \"The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show\". \n\n\nOfficial Site: Fergie.com\nBrazilian Site: FergieBR.com\n\nB) Fergie (real name Robert Ferguson) is a electronic music artist and DJ from Larne, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. He has mixed sets and released singles under the name Fergie, most notably for Godskitchen, Mixmag and Radio 1.\n\nMore information can be found on Fergie on Wikipedia <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fergie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
