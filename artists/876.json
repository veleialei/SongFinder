A year later, Murphy's debut album Out With a Bang was released; overall, it produced four chart singles, including his Number One single to date, 1995's \"Dust on the Bottle\". His follow-up albums, Gettin' Out the Good Stuff (1996) and We Can't All Be Angels (1997) were less successful than their predecessors, and by 1998, Murphy was dropped from MCA's roster; a fourth album, Tryin' to Get There, was released in 2004 on Koch Entertainment.\n\nBetween 1994 and 2004, Murphy charted a total of thirteen singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts, one of which (1995's \"Dust on the Bottle\") reached Number One. In addition, he has co-written singles for other country artists, including \"Living in Fast Forward\", a Number One single for Kenny Chesney in 2006. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Lee+Murphy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
