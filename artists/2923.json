In 2004, Roommate re-emerged as a live band. Work on the full-length Songs the Animals Taught Us began soon thereafter, and the album was self-released in the summer of 2005. A wide release on the Plug Research label followed in the spring of 2006 and was supported with a European tour and a few shows around the United States. Production on the New Steam EP began in late 2006 and the band continued recording steadily through the completion of its 2nd full-length, We Were Enchanted. Its third album Guilty Rainbow will be released in spring 2011. Lambert is the primary songwriter, but all members actively contribute to the live arrangements and recordings.\n\nSites: roommatemusic.com\n\n2) A pseudonym of dubstep producer Justin McCaulley (b. San Francisco, CA, USA) - representing the Bay Area dubstep movement since 2003.
