He released his debut LP City Limits Volume 1 in July 2009 on Deep Medi Musik, a dubstep label run by Mala of Digital Mystikz . He was personally chosen by Mala, along with collaborator Quest, to represent the growing global bass scene in Mary-Anne Hobbs' live mix showcase Generation Bass in September 2008 on BBC Radio 1, two-and-a-half years after the seminal Dubstep Warz.\n\n\"It's fair to say the dubstep scene has splintered and refracted into myriad Sub(bass)styles over the last couple of years, but at the epicentre of the scene are a few artists who have maintained the original spirit of the style while alloying it successfully with influences that were always hovering on the edges, but never fully integrated. Silkie is one of those artists...who's heated elements of deeper house and synth driven soul around the glowing core of DMZ's bassbins to create one of the lushest fusions in the scene.\" Boomkat, July 2009. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Silkie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
