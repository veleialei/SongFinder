She then joined the group Menudo and performed often in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Soon after that, she became a vocalist for the group Kaviar, then she joined another group known as Punto G. In the early 1990s, she decided to step into the acting world; played roles in TV series and starred in the movie Weekend War. She then focused on her music career and went on as a solo artist. BMG Records fell in love with her and signed her on to the label. In 1995, she released her self-titled debut album Gisselle, which went platinum with two successful singles; \"Perfume De Mujer En Tu Camisa\" (Woman's Perfume on Your Shirt) and \"Pesadilla\" (Nightmare). Her career took off, and she released numerous other albums during the next few years and collaborated with artist such as Sergio Vargas to release the hit \"Juntos.\" In 1999, she returned to the acting world when she played a role in El Día Menos Pensado (The Day least Thought Of).\n\nGisselle gained success with her 2000 album Voy a Enamorarte (I'm Going to Love You), the album was nominated at the 2001 Grammy Awards for Best Merengue Album, and later that year, her hit single from the album \"Júrame\" (Swear To me) won a Latin Grammy Award for Best Tropical Song. Since then, Gisselle has become popular, especially in her ancestral homeland of Puerto Rico. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gisselle\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
