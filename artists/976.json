Continuing the minimal, menacing electronics of early Klinik releases, but with a heavier, more saturated edge, Dive's distinct sound has been a highly influential presence in the EBM and electro-industrial scene.  Sister project Sonar is an equally respected rhythmic noise project in the vein of Esplendor Geométrico, while the pre-Klinik electropunk project Absolute Body Control was recently reformed with long-time friend and brother-in-law Eric Van Wonterghem of Insekt and Monolith.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nDIVE is an ongoing project composed of Beach Fossils guitarist Cole Smith, Devin Ruben Perez, Andrew Bailey, and ex-Smith Westerns drummer Colby Hewitt. DIVE released  the Sometime 7 inch on Captured Tracks on Oct. 11th, 2011 with another planned for November 29th and an EP coming in December. As of May 1st, 2012, this band is now known as DIIV.\n_________________________________________\n\nDIVE are no strangers to the music scene of South New Jersey and Philadelphia, PA (USA). They are a straightforward band of aggressive and melodic rock that compares to the sounds of Three Days Grace, Hoobastank and Fuel. DIVE formed back in 2004, taking time to create and focus their sound while playing local club and bar gigs around their hometowns. In 2007, “The Truth About Us” was self-released and eventually gained widespread attention for this dynamic band. \n\nDive’s most recent success occurred in late 2009. This included signing with Phase One Communications/Mad Rock Music and recording their latest album, “Picture Perfect”, with famed producer, Jim Wirt (Incubus, No Doubt, Live, Jack’s Mannequin). The band spent the holidays at the legendary 4th Street Recording Studios in Santa Monica, CA, where the hum of the Beach Boys’ melodies still linger in the place that gave birth to their sound decades earlier. The album is being released through Sony RED on 5/11/2010. \n\nA band driven by purpose and filled with passion, “Picture Perfect,” hits you fast and hard with a fury of tight rhythms and distorted guitars from beginning to end. Having a great record filled with addicting hooks and head banging beats is just not enough for these young rockers. “It’s all about having the live show to back it up” Jonny Sitar (lead vocals) says. \n\nDIVE consistently delivers a tight and energetic live show, going all out and leaving the audience screaming for more. Sitar, commands the stage as well as the crowd with his uncanny vocal performance while connecting with the audience through stories of love and loss. Evan Canova and Jeff Moczydlowski dual between rhythm and lead while delivering both color and drive simultaneously backed by a rhythm section with more than enough backbone between bass player, Teddy Agelis, and drummer Zhach Kelsch.\n\nDive has already built a devoted fan base thanks to the support of 93.3 WMMR (Philadelphia), the first radio station to feature Dive in full-rotation, and will be soon be launching their new single, “Last Call Romance” in the Tri-state area with the help of Land Shark Promotion Studio. 2010 presents a promising outlook of success and longevity for DIVE as they continue their pursuits of notoriety and merit.\n\nDIVE IS: \nJonny Dive - Lead Vocals\nJeff Moczydlowski - Guitar\nEvan Canova - Guitar\nTeddy Agelis - Bass\nZhach Kelsch - Drums\n\nPast members included:\nMike Morgan  Bass (The Drama Club, Panacea)\nBrian Weaver Bass (Silvertide, Automatic Fire, Terrible Things)\n\n\nVISIT DIVE @ \nhttp://www.divemusic.net\nhttp://www.myspace.com/dive\nhttp://www.twitter.com/dive\nhttp://www.facebook.com/DiveBand\n\nDisclaimer: Dive can also be scrobbled on Last.fm under DiveUSA due to the band name 'Dive' not available for use.
