Their take on indie rock smacks together an eclectic montage of punkish guitars, electronic beats, synths and samples, combined with irrepressible vocals and a super-octane live performance. \n\nThe band consists of: Jess (Jeremy de Tolly) on vocals, guitar and programming, Sumo (David Moffatt) on guitar and vocals, Passion (Maurice Paliaga) on Bass, and Markie D (Mark De Menezes) on drums mixing up a combination acoustic / electronic kit. \n\nUp till now\n\nThe Dirty Skirts have continued to deliver inspired performances in and around South Africa, fuelling their reputation as a top live act to follow. Stage magazine dubbed their performances as \"explosive\" and referenced The Cure, Bauhaus and Kraftwerk in the eclectic montage of guitars and beats. \nAmongst other, The Dirty Skirts have:\n- Been featured Cape Town artists at the Cell C Sound of the City along with Arno Carstens, Ready D, Freshlyground, and Louise Carver\n- Performed at the Obs Festival with Bed on Bricks, Waddy Jones and Roswell Kings\n- Headlined capacity shows at Mercury Live, Roxy's, The Independent Armchair Theatre, Joburg Bar, Club + (188 Bree Street) and the Mercury Lounge in Cape Town\n- Played as a featured artist with The Most Amazing Show's Culture Klap at the Grahamstown Festival\n- Played at the Oppikopi Festival in August 2005. \n- Opened for one of South Africa's most well known rock bands (Arno Carstens) at Mercury Live. \n- Performed in Austin, Texas as part of the SXSW festival.\n- Gained a record deal with SonyBMG.\n- And released three albums including On A Stellar Bender, Daddy Don't Disco, and their  debut mini-album, called The Dirty Skirts. \n\nIn the media:\n\nDespite their relatively brief tenure (first live performance was November 2004) they had their profile propelled to national status by the radio friendly single \"Little Tsunami,\" which received intermittent spins on the primary national broadcaster (5FM) for several months. The silky but bruised sound, and uplifting lyrics of Little Tsunami won Blunt Magazine's Doc Martens Demo Competition, and has also featured on Cell C's radio promotion to uncover local talent on three separate occasions.\n\nMedia exposure has been accelerated by the launch of their debut EP in June 2005. The EP was launched at Vegas Room, where they put on scorching live performance to a packed house. The event attracted media attention form the likes of Blunt Magazine, SL and a camera crew from ETV who covered the show for Nicky Greenwall's \"The Showbiz Report\" (broadcast in late June 2005). The EP has recently been playlisted on 5FM, TUKS FM, East Coast Radio and various University radio stations. The track \"Set Me Alight\" climbed to number one on Mweb's SA MP3 chart, where it resided for five weeks. It has also climbed to #4 on UCT Radio's local & international charts. Another driven rock track, \"Feeling the Pressure\" recently reached number one on the SA chart at TuksFM, and soared to #2 on their top 40.\n\nSound of the City, a showcase concert designed to highlight the influential sounds of each of South Africa's major cities, featured The Dirty Skirts in November 2005. The performance was then broadcast to millions of South Africans on SABC 2.\n\nTheir first full length debut album On A Stellar Bender was released in 2007, with the barnstorming single “Homewrecker” reaching #1 on a number of national radio charts. The Dirty Skirts made a music video for this song, it was directed by Christoff Vermeulen. Another single \"Is This It?\" from this album made its way onto national radio charts.\n\nIn June 2008, The Dirty Skirts released their second studio album named Daddy Don't Disco. Its first single \"Cant Remember Your Name\" hit national radio playlists after a while of silence from The Skirts. A music video was produced for this song. The band embarked on an SA album launch Tour from June to July and will depart for their UK Tour in August. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Dirty+Skirts\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
