He has been described as an important name in the development of the dubstep style for his fusion of the already existing South London dubstep sound with the newer East London born grime sound, and was also one of the first dubstep producers when the style was emerging in the early 2000s. He has been featured on a variety of compilations including Mary Anne Hobbs's The Warrior Dubz, Tempa's The Roots of Dubstep and the BBC 1Xtra anniversary mix. In 2008 he published his album Diary of An Afro Warrior. Read more at www.benga.co.uk <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Benga\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
