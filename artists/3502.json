They were discovered and signed by the producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz.\n\nKasenetz, Katz and Elliot Chiprut produced the song \"Little Bit O'Soul\", which paved the way for bubblegum pop bands like Ohio Express and 1910 Fruitgum Company. The song was a million seller (Laurie Records #3380, subsequently reissued on Buddah Records) but was the band's only hit. It was written by John Carter and Ken Lewis, who went on to write big hits for The Ivy League and Herman's Hermits.\n\nLead singer Jamie Lyons also recorded several solo singles on Laurie while still recording with the group. His first single, \"Soul Struttin'\" became a Northern Soul hit in several Northeast regions. Lyons died of heart failure at his home in Little River, SC on September 25, 2006. He was 57.\n\n\"Little Bit O'Soul\" has been subsequently covered by several bands including The Ramones and 2 Live Crew, who sampled the melody. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Music+Explosion\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
