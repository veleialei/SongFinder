The band was formed in 2000 by frontman Joey Duenas.\n\nThe band's first album Healing struggled to sell, and the band received little support from their label Maverick Records.\n\nUltimately, Maverick gave them a second chance and they recorded their second album Becoming i in 2003. This time, the label supported them and got them touring with big name bands such as Korn and Disturbed. They also appeared at Ozzfest 2003. The album was produced by Andrew Murdock, responsible for Powerman 5000, Godsmack and Chimaira among other artists. Even with a more focussed sound and better production, Becoming i failed to sell, and the band split up that same year.\n\nSince then, guitarist Marc Serrano (who was recruited for the second album) joined the now departed metalcore group A Dozen Furies, vocalist Joey Duenas formed a band called A New Revolution (featuring members from Slaves On Dope), and Pete Navarrete formed a band called Exit The Sun.\n\nÜnloco are doing a reunion show on September, 20, 2014. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/%C3%9Cnloco\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
