Using a witty, self-mocking style, Wainwright has recorded over twenty albums on eleven different labels. Two of his albums have been nominated for Grammy awards.\n\nHe is also a regular actor in Judd Apatow movies. His biggest role was playing the father on Judd's show, Undeclared.\n\nIn 2012 his latest offering Older Than My Old Man Now was released.\n\nOfficial website : http://www.lwiii.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Loudon+Wainwright+III\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
