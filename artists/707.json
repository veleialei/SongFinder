Hammond also left to pursue a career with the group Radical For Christ. He was replaced by Montrell Darrett. By 2000, Marcus Cole and Chris Poole had taken the place of Sapp and Darrett on the group's last studio album. In 2002 Commissioned released a reunion album which brought back most of the group's former members and featured most of its greatest hits. The group performed live on stage during the 2002 Stellar Awards in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n(2) An urban Black gospel band with crossover appeal, Commissioned are an extremely evangelistic group in concert who put on such a dramatic show that the altars are routinely packed with repenters following their performances. Members Fred Hammond, Keith Staten, Michael Brooks and Marvin Sapp have all done many successful solo projects as well. They spent most of the '90s pursuing those careers, but found themselves back together in 2001 for a reunion tour and the first of another successful series of albums. ~ Bil Carpenter, Rovi <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Commissioned\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
