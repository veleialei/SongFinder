The band’s music can be described as technical death/thrash metal, focusing primarily on melody and song structures. Cantara is known as a tight and energetic live band, having played extensively throughout Holland and Germany with Swedish, Argentine, American, English and German bands.\n \nFourteen years after its rise, Cantara’s individual band members have made a name for themselves in bands such as God Dethroned, Sinister, Salacious Gods, Seizure and Autumn and have earned a reputation as producers and session musicians in the heavy music scene. \n \nCantara, meanwhile, is more alive that ever. Recordings for the full length “A Moment To Reconsider” have been completed. Recording and mixing took place at Franky’s Recording Kitchen, with production in the hands of the band, aided by Berthus Westerhuis. Now teaming up with The Electric Company/Universal Music to release the 8 track CD, Cantara will emerge from obscurity a stronger and more mature band, with a live repertoire exceeding two hours. Upon release, the band aim to thoroughly promote the material with a national and international club tour, hitting the studio shortly thereafter to back it all up with a next full length release.\n\nLine up:\n\nMats van der Valk - bass & lead vocals       \nPascal Grevinga - guitars \nJens van der Valk - guitars & vocals\nChris Oldenburger - drums     \n\nhttp://www.cantaraband.com/\n\nRecent album:\nA Moment To Reconsider\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cantara\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
