He sings in a low, whispery voice somewhat akin to Leonard Cohen or Benjamin Biolay, and his music videos established his innovative and creative flair visually. He cites Francoise Hardy as one of his main influences.\n\nHe is best known in Britain for his appearence on the number 11 Saint Etienne hit single \"He's On The Phone\", which is an English-language adaptation of his 1984 French-language hit \"Weekend à Rome\". He also collaborated with Saint Etienne on the Resurrection EP, his album Eden, and his single \"Le Premier Jour\", itself based on the track \"Ready or Not\" from Sarah Cracknell's 1997 solo album \"Lipslide\".\n\nHis duets and collaborations both on stage and in the studio with other artists have been extensive and he has worked with the likes of Chris Isaak, Marianne Faithfull, Elli Medeiros, Astrud Gilberto, Vanessa Daou, the Swingle Singers, and more. Most recently, he released a duet (\"If\") with Charlotte Gainsbourg in 2004.\n\nHis 1996 album Eden displayed a diverse array of electronic-oriented songs that included downtempo ballads, drum 'n' bass-influenced tracks, and HiNRG dance.\n\nAfter a 20-track greatest hits compilation (Singles) in 1998, Corps & armes in 2000 saw Daho return to a more orchestral sound fuelled by traditional instruments: piano, acoustic guitar, horns.\n\nDaho shifted gears once again for his 2004 album Réévolution, which featured a guitar-heavy rock sound.\n\nIn 2012, he produced and composed songs for French comedian/singer Lou Doillon for her first album  Places. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Etienne+Daho\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
