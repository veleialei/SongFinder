Well, Oscar and Kasper are what people in the biz call ‘lifers’. Oscar has been in and around clubs since the year dot: one of Scotland’s original acid house converts, whether it be DJing at the Sub Club or The Arches or releasing three of the first ten Soma tracks. For the past decade Oscar has been constructing the club night Mish Mash – a night famed for its wide and wonderful musical policy. His passion is no mere fashion. Likewise, Kasper. A classically trained musical prodigy hailing from Denmark, he wrote his first film score at 13; joined a radio orchestra at 14; was a session drummer in New York for the likes of Teddy Pendergrass and Terry Riley; and has released his own music in various bands and solo projects. This unstoppable duo are joined by vocalist Louise Norbye aka Lois – she hails from Copenhagen, with a background that takes in ballet dancing and performing as a singer and actress in Denmark and beyond. With Oscar’s wife supplying the lyrics, Mish Mash was born. With a live plot coming together and an album a certainty, Mish Mash are a wonderfully inspiring proposition. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mish+Mash\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
