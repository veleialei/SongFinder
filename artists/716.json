This incarnation of Controlled Dissonance arose from a visceral need to return to his roots in sonic experimentation. An unquenchable desire to cast aside the restraints of contemporary musical structure and design and revert to a more simple time when creating \"music\" was sitting in a room with too much time and a ton of cheap musical accoutrements to generate sound. Controlled Dissonance is divided between two distinct endeavors: live and studio. Studio work is the boring, yet fulfilling process of audio manipulation with various software applications, occasionally incorporating some sort of field recording. Live work is performance art. Improvisational dark ambient/noise created with the assistance of a slew of toys - some traditional, some handcrafted via circuit bending. No two live performances are ever the same. That is Controlled Dissonance. The pages here flesh out the story a bit with various other bits of information. Yeah... so that's about all I want to say. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Controlled+Dissonance\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
