Their first appearance was as the first act in the \"battle of the bands\" sequence in Cheech and Chong's film, \"Up In Smoke\" (although the only shot of any band members is of drummer Buddy Hate complaining that he could not hear anything without stage monitors). Soon after forming in 1977 the band relocated to San Francisco and then Los Angeles, becoming one of the major bands in the early LA punk scene. They were known for their conspicuous radical left politics, and for a strong melodic sense that earned them the nickname \"punk rock Everly Brothers\".\n\nThe Dils broke up in 1980, after having released three singles: \"I Hate the Rich\"/\"You're Not Blank,\" \"Mr. Big\"/\"Class War,\" and \"Made in Canada.\" The last, a three-sided double-7\", showed a gathering roots rock orientation. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Dils\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
