His debut album was released February 6, 2007.\n\nCarroll said in an interview with Songfacts that he looks at songwriting as an almost religious experience. The ideas are out there, he believes, and it's up to the individual to grab them and write them. \"And you can either force the idea, almost screw it up if you really force it too much, or you can try to receive it the way it's intended to be,\" he explained. \"And so my songwriting experience is, usually when I'm writing by myself, I just kind of let the idea come. And if it's a roadblock or whatever I may try to hammer through it for a minute, but then if I don't get anything I'll just leave it alone and come back to it a couple of weeks later.\"\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Michael+Carroll\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
