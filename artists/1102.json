Formed by Mike Thibeau (bass, keyboards and programming), Rob Gardner (drums and programming) and Japanese singer/songwriter Kaoru, this band has seen its music quickly rise above the stagnant pond of nameless generic electronica to become something that will be listened to long after the dance dust settles.\n\nThe band is well known in the world of online music, having been named the best electronic act of 1999 on MP3.com, and also having well over half a million downloads from the site before it closed down in late 2003. Electrostatic has also received critical acclaim “offline” from magazines like UK’s Future Music, DJ Magazine, Hot Press and Burnitblue as well as US magazines like Outburn, XLR8R and the now defunct Revolution & Mixer.\n\nThe trio has made quite a name for themselves in the television and film industry, having licensed music to programs on NBC, CBS, MTV, FOX, UPN and the WB Network, as well as major motion pictures like Valentine (Warner Bros. Pictures) and X-Change (Tri-Mark Pictures). Fans of The Matrix movies have also been exposed Electrostatic’s music by way of the last 3 Matrix DVD releases. Electrostatic has had 10 of their songs featured on The Matrix RELOADED, The ANIMATRIX, and The Matrix Revisited DVDs.\n\nElectrostatic is a band that has a reputation for their high energy live performances. They have played many high profile shows at world famous venues such as L.A.’s Viper Room, Whisky A Go-Go, The Knitting Factory and The Roxy Theater, as well as the 2000 Vans Warped Tour in Anaheim, CA, the 2000 NXNW Music Conference, and Sundance 2004.\n\nElectrostatic’s AWAKE ALONE CD was released in 2002 with nationwide distribution. The band financed their own professional, high-quality music video for the first single “Stay Awake”. The sci-fi influenced video (directed by Paul Minor, who recently directed BT’s “Simply Being Loved - Somnambulist\" video) has aired on cable TV, and has been seen by fans worldwide on the band’s web-site, and other high profile sites like Launch.com and MP4.com.\n\nThe band is currently writing and recording new material for a follow up release, and can be seen performing regularly in Los Angeles area clubs. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Electrostatic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
