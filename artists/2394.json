The band is led by singer David Usher. Other members of the band are Mark Makoway (guitars), Francis Fillion (drums), Louis Lalancette (bass), Jonathan Gallivan (guitars) and Kevin Young (keyboards). Former members include Jeff Pearce (bass) and Paul Wilcox (drums).\n\nMoist formed in the early 1990s and eventually released an independent cassette in 1993. The cassette caught the attention of EMI, who released their first full-length studio CD, Silver, in 1994. Producer Terry Brown (Rush, Blue Rodeo) was brought in to work on a few of the band's songs, and the  album went on to sell 400,000 copies in Canada on the strength of hard-hitting singles like Push, Silver and Believe Me.  The follow up, Creature, was released in 1996 to even greater success, with the band's sound maturing and fostering its softer side. A final studio album titled Mercedes 5 and Dime was released in 1999 which was softer and more melancholic than previous releases.\n\nMoist have called off their indefinite hiatus as of September 2013, and released their new single \"Mechanical\" on May 23rd, 2014.\n\n2) After a life-long love affair with music, songwriter and producer, David Elfström Lilja, began releasing his own music under the name Moist in 2008.

His most recent work with hits like \"On And On\" and \"Release Me\" by Agnes, are enjoying heavy rotation on European radio stations. He just finished the single, “Far Beyond The Endless,” with Maria Marcus and writing and producing a track with the Japanese singer and keyboardist, Kana Otsubo, of Spangle Call Lilli Line, which will appear on Moist’s album due at the end 2009, early 2010.\n\n3) Moist is an Indie Rock/Shoegaze band from Semarang, Indonesia. you can check them at http://soundcloud.com/moistband.
