Nalle would write and produce much of GLAD's early material in addition to his role as lead vocalist. The other members (from Temple University in Philadelphia) were Bob Kauflin (keyboards, vocals), T. Coble (bass, vocals), John Bolles (guitar, vocals), and Brad Curry (drums). The group's name was chosen from a poll taken at a shopping mall. Playing over 200 dates annually at college campuses, churches and concert halls throughout the United States, GLAD released their first two albums on Myrrh Records in 1978 and 1980. \n\n\"The Reason\" (on Beyond a Star) was their first a cappella song, which they subsequently re-recorded for their 1988 watershed album, The Acapella Project. That album was released with some trepidation because there was no track record in the genre for the Christian market, but it proved tremendously popular (selling over 400,000 copies), and received a Dove Award nomination and a Billboard Critic's Choice Award. Since that time, GLAD has alternated band and a cappella recordings and increased their admirers, evidenced by new groups that are obviously influenced by the group's elaborate, multilayered sound.\n\nGLAD ventured into the mainstream with their 1995 release, A Cappella Gershwin (featuring some arrangements by the legendary Gene Puerling), which set the a cappella world buzzing and helped introduce their music to a wider audience. \n\nGLAD's current lineup includes Nalle and longtime members Chris Davis (a musician with a strong background in classical and electric guitar, plus session work in the Northwest) and John Gates (an experienced studio percussionist who backed Gladys Knight & the Pips, Frankie and the Knockouts, and others), plus alternating keyboardists Paul Langford and Don Pardoe. Kauflin and Don Hart are the group's primary a cappella arrangers. Recently, the group has released recordings inspired by the writings of John Piper and the worship music of Sovereign Grace Ministries (formerly PDI).\n-------------------------------------------------------\n2 - The second band calling itself Glad is Timothy B. Schmit's band, who made one album in 1968 before he left to join Poco and become a leading figure in the development and evolution of Country Rock.\n-------------------------------------------------------\n3 - Third, Glad is also the name of a little-known UK indie band. Formed in Oxford in 1988, the band that was to become Glad changed their name more often than their underwear. Settling on Smitty’s Chopper for their first gig, the band’s original line-up was Mark Jordan (bass & vocals), Tony Greenham (guitar), Jon Williams (guitar), Will Crerar (drums) and John Tabinor (vocals). Jordan soon took over as main vocalist with Tabinor opting to leave rather than become an embarrassing appendage. The band’s name gradually morphed into Paisley Nightmare and Angus-Boyd Heron was recruited on bass, leaving Jordan free to focus on his frontman persona. After a final, Madchester-inspired name change to Glad and a personnel change in the drumming department, the band split in 1992.\n-------------------------------------------------------\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Glad\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
