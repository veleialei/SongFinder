Joining solid groove with sounds of serenity, their signature aesthetic feels as natural on the dance floor as it does after hours or on the mat.  Due in no small part to Desert Dwellers’ pioneering spirit, the very concept of chill-out and sacred bass music has expanded dramatically. Skillfully blending deep bass, earthy percussion, etheric voices and culture-crossing instrumentation into a sonic incense for mind and body, Desert Dwellers offers a spellbinding hybrid with echoes of our tribal past and future.  These two sound alchemists offer cutting edge techniques that blend the modern edge of electronica with the ancient sounds of cultures past. The result has been the prolific production of genre blending dance tracks and downtempo grooves that make for truly memorable listening experiences.\n\nDesert Dwellers primarily consists of Amani Friend and Treavor Moontribe, amongst a webwork of inspiring collaborators; together they are one of the most pioneering and prolific downtempo artists hailing from the United States. After the success of the DownTemple Dub series on White Swan, and performances at some of the most prominent music festivals in North America, including Lightning In A Bottle, Symbiosis, Wanderlust, Shambhala, Photosynthesis, Beloved, and Earthdance, Desert Dwellers are utilizing 2012 to release three cutting edge remix albums that will feature some of the top dub producers on the planet, as well as work on a new album of original material and head out on tour to some of the most progressive festivals across the country and around the world.\n\nDesert Dwellers was initially created out of a collaboration in the late 90's between electronic music pioneers Amani Friend & Treavor Moontribe (aka Amani vs Teapot). The group has their roots in the Southern California dance collective known as Moontribe, famous in the electronic underground for organizing dance rituals at magical locations deep within the vast expanses of Southern California and New Mexico deserts. Desert Dwellers has been blessed to collaborate with an amazingly talented group of artists over the years, including work in the studio with other producers like Rara Avis and Craig Kohland on the DownTemple Dub series. Their remixes can be found on albums by Adham Shaikh, Kalya Scintilla, Karsh Kale, David Starfire, and many others in the underground electronic music scene. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Desert+Dwellers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
