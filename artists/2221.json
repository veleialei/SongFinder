In the United Kingdom the song was covered by Susan Maughan who had the hit. \"What Does A Girl Do?\", the follow-up single, rose to #82 on the Hot 100 list in early 1963, and was Blane's only other appearance on any Billboard chart. \n\nLate in her senior year at Jamaica High School in 1961, she was asked by a friend to record a demo for a song he had written.  While at the studio, Marv Holtzman, the A&R man for Seville Records, heard Marcie sing and signed her to a contract.  The first song that he found for her to record was \"Bobby's Girl\".\nBlane continued to record for Seville through 1965 but they were never able to find a song that would have the success as her very first hit. While she enjoyed music, she didn't enjoy the business and wouldn't record again.\nPost-music, Marcie went to Queens College and became a teacher.\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Marcie+Blane\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
