He began playing progressive trance from the end of 1993. In 2001, after many years as DJ and producing in the studio, where he has played and performed at big raves and festivals, next to people like Tiesto and Armin van Buuren, he decided to start a new project and Liquid Soul was born. \n\nIn 2006 he founded his own label Mikrokosmos records. Besides solo project Sleek, he also partners Martin Knecht in the deadly duo Earsugar.\n\nBeing behind the best selling albums on Iboga Records as Liquid Soul, „synthetic vibes“, „love in stereo“ and „cocktails“, over 100 hypnotic releases on top labels and playing worldwide over a decade, he finally won the Beatport award for the best psytrance track in 2009. In 2010 he achieved his biggest success by winning the price of the best Beatport artist, best Beatport track and the Dj Awards in Ibiza in psy trance categories.\n\nAfter many releases on top labels and playing in brasil, japan, mexico, uk, germany, greece, israel, portugal, belgium, austria, hungary, italy...., the long awaited debut album of Liquid Soul, released on Iboga Records, hits the street in 2006 and was the best selling album in the progressive scene in this year. With perfectly produced pumping tunes he rocked the progressive dance floors all over the globe. It’s a milestone in the Iboga records catalogue.\n\nHe is also has another solo project Sleek, https://www.discogs.com/artist/812589-Sleek\n\n2) Chicago, US acid jazz outfit Liquid Soul originally comprised saxophonist/musical director Mars Williams, DJ Jesse de la Peña, guitarist Tommy Klein, bassist Ricky Showalter, trumpeter Ron Haynes, keyboardist Frankie Hill, and drummer Dan Leali; formed in 1993, the group quickly emerged as a Windy City club favorite thanks to their regular Sunday night gigs at the Elbo Room, and soon recorded a self-titled debut LP for their own Soul What label. A series of high-profile gigs including appearances at President Bill Clinton's inaugural parade in Washington, D.C., as well as basketball star Dennis Rodman's birthday party greatly boosted Liquid Soul's visibility, and in 1996 their album was reissued on the Ark 21 label; moving their regular Sunday gigs to Chicago's Double Door, the group — now featuring Williams, Showalter, Haynes, Hill, and Leali in addition to new recruits including DJ Ajax, rapper the Dirty MF, guitarist Tommy Sanchez, trombonist John Janowiak, percussionist Newt Cole, and vocalist Simone (the daughter of the great Nina Simone) — issued their sophomore record, Make Some Noise, in 1998. Here's the Deal followed two years later.
