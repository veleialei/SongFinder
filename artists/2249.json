Known as \"La Dama de Hierro\", Marisela recorded her first album at the age of 15 in 1984 and continues to release albums into the twenty first century.\nMarisela's early career was helped immensely by the famous Mexican TV show of Siempre en Domingo by Raúl Velasco and then later expanding into the United States by the help of many other Spanish broadcasting shows such as Cristina, Don Francisco, Sábado Gigante, and many other televised shows famous in the 80's and 90's. Marisela's first record release was titled Sin El a production of Enrique Elizondo and songs from the now well known Marco Antonio Solís who composed all the songs of her first hit album. Thanks to the wonderful song writer/composer and singer Marco Antonio Solis, who is one of Mexico's greatest music artists of all time, her romantic CD was an instant hit. \"La Pareja Ideal\" a duet between Marisela and Marco Antonio Solis is one of her most memorable songs, being promoted while the two were actually dating.\n\nThe romance ended of course because of the love triangle between Marisela, Marco Antonio Solis and Beatriz Adrianna who was also a beautiful rising artist whose album Marco Antonio Solis was promoting.\n\nMarisela is one of very few singers who have managed to survive in the music business only by playing concerts in Mexican venues known as palenques.\n\nMarisela has continued recording great hit songs like, \"Completamente Tuya\", \"Enamorada y Herida\", \"Sola con mi Soledad\", \"Ya No\", \"El Chico Aquel\", \"Mi Problema\" and many more.\n\nIn 2007, Marisela released a compilation of greatest hits entitled Noches Eternas with a Mariachi sound to it. She is preparing to release the most waited for production of No Soy Una Mentirosa this year.\n\nMarisela is one of the artists that will always remain a favorite in the hearts of her audience. Now in the heart of a new generation to come that is through their ancestors listening to her songs and becoming fans of her all over again. She is now known as \"La Dama de Hierro.\" To date, Marisela has recorded 14 albums.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Marisela\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
