He has been nominated for five Grammy Awards.\n\nHis GRP debut album Freedom at Midnight was his biggest seller and most popular album. Benoit also says that it was his favorite album to produce, because it was when \"everything came together,\" as he stated in an interview on smoothviews.com.\n\nOut of respect for one of his main influencers, Bill Evans, he dedicated his 1992 album Letter to Evan to him.\n\nMany of his songs employed a string section, most notably on his American Landscape and Orchestral Stories albums in 1997 and 2005, respectively. He has said that it is his dream to release a symphonic album.\n\nIn 2000, after the death of Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz, he released a memorial album entitled Here's to You, Charlie Brown: 50 Great Years! Collaborators included the chorus group Take 6, guitarist Mark Antoine and trumpeter Chris Botti. He also did the music for \"Peanuts\" in the later specials.\n\nHe is a close friend of The Rippingtons' guitarist and lead Russ Freeman, and they often appeared on each other's albums. They also released collaborative efforts The Benoit/Freeman Project and The Benoit / Freeman Project 2. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Benoit\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
