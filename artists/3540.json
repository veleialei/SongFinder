The Red Telephone consists of: \nMatt Hutton - vocals, guitar \nSean Toohey - guitar, vocals \nPat MacDonald - bass, vocals \nMark Britton - drums\n\nInitially they were signed to Warner Brothers Records, but their first release languished under improper promotions. They turned to the indie scene with the release of their 5 track EP \"Aviation\", and then with a followup full length album, \"Cellar Songs\" on the indie label \"Raise Giant Frogs\". The band disbanded in 2002, but they eventually reformed with the same old members. In September 2014, they released their comeback album \"Places You Return\" as the result of a Kickstarter campaign.\n\nTheir indie CDs are available on CD Baby. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Red+Telephone\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
