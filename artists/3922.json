His high energy, and fearless stage presence has made him a favorite among colleges and clubs all around North America, as he now makes his way through the American Market. He resides in the entertainment capital of Los Angeles, and he can be seen performing regularly at such clubs as the Improv, The Laugh Factory and the Comedy Store, in the Hollywood area. \n\nAdam has also gone global! Not only did he complete a tremendously successful USO tour for the American troops in Japan/Korea/Guam, he’s added Australia to the list and has recently performed at Melbourne International Comedy Festival. Also a writer and an actor, Adam has appeared on Nickelodeon, Fox Sports Net, and several nationally televised commercials, as well as being staff writer for an animated series in Canada called Chilly Beach. With his fun persona, Richmond has the ability to make an audience feel comfortable in his presence, and has definitely become a candidate as one of the new comedy faces the world will see for many years to come. Go see Richmond and witness how much you can get away with when an audience likes you. His goal has always been to; “Bring mirth and merriment to misunderstood people in a chaotic world. I may not be there in the morning, but if I’m there at night, you will have a good time.” – Adam Richmond 1999 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Adam+Richmond\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
