He was born in Nea Kokinia, Piraeus on 29th September 1949. His father was Loukas Daralas (Λουκάς Νταράλας), a famous singer of rembetika. \n\nMuch of Dalaras’ work is dedicated to the history of the Cypriot political situation. He was initially inspired by the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. However, he has been noted for continuing political themes into the late 1980s and early 1990s, when he produced many concerts for the cause of the Cypriot people.\n\nDalaras has sold more than 10,000,000 records in his career and is regarded as one of the biggest names in contemporary Greek music. He has toured extensively throughout the world and was invited to sing for Nelson Mandela on his birthday.\n\nSince 1981, he has performed in over 500 concerts outside Greece, promoting Hellenic culture abroad. He has performed at the Palais des Gongres in Paris, London’s Wembley arena, Toronto, Montreal, and in Meadowlands in New Jersey before an audience of 22,000. In recognition of this and other humanitarian contributions, he received the Kennedy Award from Senator Edward Kennedy. He has also appeared at numerous cultural festivals, including Cuba, the Europalia Festival in Brussels, the Peace Festival in Vienna, the Youth Festival in Moscow, the Aid to Africa Concert in the Statium of Peace and Friendship in Athens, and the Amnesty International Concert in Athens with Peter Gabriel, Sting, Bruce Springsteen, Tracy Chapman, and Yousou n’Dour.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/George+Dalaras\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
