The duo started working club dates around the city and, by 1934, Gillum started recording for ARC and Bluebird Records.\n\nWith his characteristic high, reedy harmonica sound, he appeared on many of the highly popular \"Bluebird beat\" recordings produced by Lester Melrose in the 1930s and 1940s, under his own name and as a sideman. However, after the Bluebird label folded in the late 1940s he made few further recordings, dying in Chicago as a result of a gunshot wound. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jazz+Gillum\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
