He has also provided licensed remixes for media darlings The xx and illustrious RnB/Soul vocalists Erykah Badu and Brandy. Cayzer has been gaining vocal supporters such as BBC Radio 1 DJ and electronic music evangelist Mary Anne Hobbs and contributed a mix to her show. Like label mate James Blake, he has garnered praise from influential sources such as Pitchfork and Resident Advisor and is considered one of the central producers in a new wave of British dance music being labelled by some as post-dubstep.

A defunct Austin, Texas-based hard rock/heavy metal band consisting of vocalist David Derrick, guitarists Jared Tuten and Kyle Ellison, bassist Sims Ellison and drummer Shandon Sahm. The band released their debut CD, \"To Mock a Killingbird,\" on Geffen Records in 1993. The band's sound was that of 1980s-influenced hard rock with an alternative lean to it.

Drum'n'Bass producers publishing on Looking Good Records and Strictly Digital Drum & Bass Recordings etc. Pariah is Phil Jones, Marc Plested, Rob Clinton & Sean Martin. Pariah were spawned from the dark years of the mid 90's. The Pariah studio was set up in 1997, after much saving and hard work. They spent the next 12 months getting to know their equipment, enabling them to carve their own sound. The next thing Pariah did was to expand further and start sending out their music. Later on they found themselves working with 'LTJ Bukem'. Pariah were offered a major deal with 'Good Looking' but after much deliberation, decided to turn it down. The reason for this was that the boys thought that they could not justify the offer of such a deal due to the amount of work involved. The Pariah boys still all work full time which does not really leave a lot of time for them to be Dj'ing all over the world and also working on their music at the same time. They also wanted to be able explore different avenues within such a varied genre of music.\n\n7. Early 80s SoCal hardcore, issued by Posh Boy Records.
