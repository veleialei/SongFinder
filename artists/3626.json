Tigerstyle are a Scottish bhangra group from Glasgow from a British Punjabi background. They are made up of two brothers, Raj and Pops, trained in classical tabla, gurmat sangeet and various forms of Punjabi folk music and instrumentation. Coming from a traditional background where religious adherence was the call of the day and learning to play instruments from a young age so that they could perform at their local temple have now turned this young Sikh outfit into the most sought after act.Recently signed to Nachural Records (the label that launched Panjabi MC onto the world stage and into a global hit), Tigerstyle are now preparing their debut single and debut album for a worldwide release.\n\nRaj and Pops come from a folk background, with the traditional upbringing of a Sikh family, with their roots in Punjab, Punjabi folk music, in particular Punjabi music from the late 1970s to early 1980s, including artists such as Kuldip Manak and Surinder Shinda as well as Bollywood music. They also list Rap, Hip hop, RnB and Drum n bass with artists such as Dr. Dre and Ice Cube as influences.\n\nThey started their music career in 1997 when as DJs they created Desi Bombsquad Sound System with the intent of nurturing the bhangra scene in Scotland as they felt it lagged behind the English bhangra scene. The name Tigerstyle is taken from the Tiger Style of Shaolin Kung Fu named after the tiger, with the brothers coming from a Sikh warrior background which has its own martial art, Gatka, and the name Singh meaning lion.\n\n2. A short lived hardcore band from Orlando, FL.\n\n3. TIGERSTYLE are a pop punk band hailing from Northampton, England. Active since 2012, there were several line-up changes before settling on their current five-piece line-up. \n\nThey have been featured on various compilations and samplers in the punk scene, with two EPs currently available (The View From Above, 2013 & The Streets We Used To Roam, 2014) and a third currently pending release (Where Do We Go From Here, 2015), with plans for a debut album by 2016.\n\nTheir main influences include Real Friends, State Champs, Transit and Knuckle Puck, to name but a few, and these are reflected in their fast, punchy and emotionally charged music. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tigerstyle\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
