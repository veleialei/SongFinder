Incorporating elements of electronic music styles such as house and techno to an indie rock format, along with fellow British groups such as The Shamen, Pop Will Eat Itself, and EMF, they were one of the leading purveyors of the early 1990s indie dance / alternative dance scene and influenced many later bands such as His Boy Elroy.\n\nThe band is led by singer-songwriter Mike Edwards. They have released six studio albums, with the latest, 'Culture Vulture', published through Mi5 Recordings in 2004. They also have made two live albums and continue to tour.
