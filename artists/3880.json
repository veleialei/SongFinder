He re-entered the personal management field and is managing producer/artist Daddy-O of Stetsasonic, X-Clan, Sonny Bonoho, Actor Tray Chaney, Met Bronson, D. Rose, Birmingham J, Ozara Ode, producer/artist Bobbie Fine; and producers: King Midas and DJ Cozmos. Additionally he has brokered for Stic. Man of Dead Prez and is the managing Consultant for the record labels NREG(Nappy Roots Entertainment Group) based in Atlanta; and Team Maverick/700 Block, based in New Jersey. YZ has helped discover such acts as Poor Righteous Teachers, Agallah, Urban Thermo Dynamics, a group feat Ces, DCQ and Mos Def. YZ expanded his entertainment realm by getting behind the scenes of the television and radio world. He is the creator, executive producer, and host of the TV show Comin at Ya Live and the Internetâ€™s first hip-hop talk-radio show The After Thought. He has recorded with Aim, Atmosphere, Brother Ali, Chuck D, Daddy-O, Jamaaladeen Tacuma, Rae & Christian, Quest Love of the Roots, The Visionaries, X-Clan, Zimbabwe Legit, 2Mex and many others.  \n\n(The summery below is a rap review for The Best of YZ LP)\n\nYZ's real name is Anthony Hill. He hails from a crew that included B Fine, Pumice Sweet Love, DJ Jah-Z, G Rock, and perhaps one and ONLY one name anybody who remembers this era of rap besides me will recognize: Tony D. If that's not ringing a bell, you're forgiven, but he was the white and somewhat chunky New Jersey native Tony Depula who produced all those militaristic and strident Poor Righteous Teacher records. Yes Tony D was way funkier than Vanilla Ice, a fact he proved by releasing his own solo album with songs like \"Check the Elevation\" that too made an impression on me that's stuck until the present day, but information about Mr. Depula is equally lackluster in a modern era that's far too quickly disposed of rap's past history. It should be noted that D's other importance in this conversation is that he produced most of the songs found within \"The Best of YZ\" although that's really not too hard to figure out. You see of the two albums Anthony Hall has credited to his moniker YZ, only one was released on Tuff City - 1990's \"Sons of the Father.\" Apparently Tuff City either could not or would not license any material from his 1993 release \"The Ghetto's Been Good to Me\" on Livin' Large Records (who knows if they even exist any more) so as a result the majority of the material on this album is drawn FROM \"Sons of the Father,\" which Tony D produced. The credibility of the term \"Best Of\" has thus unfortunately been drawn even thinner than it already was, since if you're lucky enough to have \"Sons of the Father\" in your collection you've almost got no reason to buy this record.\n\nALMOST. Despite what may be one of the most hilariously inappropriate uses of the term \"Best Of\" since the Fu-Schnickens, there's certainly no joking about YZ. History may have forgotten Anthony Hill, but this album gives him one more chance to establish the stature he should have had all along. YZ as an MC is the best parts of Wise Intelligent and AZ. He's got the unmistakably high-pitched vocal, a funky style of flow with just a hint of East coast, and even more than 15 years after the fact these beats are undeniably fat. \"Crocodile Dundee\" may fly over a lot of people's heads with NOI references to Yakub (short version of the story - an evil geneticist who created the white race by breeding out all the strength, wisdom and intelligence of the black man, making whites a sub-human race) but whether you get it or not you can nod your head to the pounding bass and the melodic rhythm of YZ's vocals. The same can be said of the swinging funk'n samples of \"Back Again,\" the slow heavy and righteous keys of \"I'm Workin',\" the punchy \"Get it Right\" and straight up toe-tapping finger-snapping \"Thinking of a Master Plan.\" The samples are old school but as fresh as a new carton of Ben & Jerry's straight out the freezer. There's only a little bit of material not found on \"Sons of the Father\" but what is there is definitely worth your time, such as the metaphorical \"When the Road Is Covered with Snow\":\n\n\"Woke up one mornin, it was kinda cold\nIn my room there was no room to consume the heat\nLooked outside where the snow's piled high\nCovered the paths of the first man's pride\nBut this won't last cause the sun still exists\nThe road symbolizes the first man's history\nList achievements, far from sufferin\nI will shine and stop the snow from smotherin\nMy pride, my blackness, my African culture\nThe snow gets thick, the road gets colder\nThe road gets harder but I hold strength of better days\nThe snow is here to stop me from gettin paid\nBut keep in mind I'm workin\nThe snow's gettin paid and he's steadily smirkin\nAs I smile cause I know somethin that he will never know\nWhen the road is covered with snow\"\n\nHailing to an era when many rappers were Afrocentric and a few were highly prejudiced against whites, one can still not deny YZ's essential point being the same as that of Afrocentricity as a whole - an answer to African history and culture being excluded from a Eurocentric educational system, whether by oversight or intentional racism. It was a point of view that in part said there's at least equal and perhaps greater educational value to the African history and culture to the European, that African history also shapes world history, and should be exposed and taught equally along with the rest. YZ comes from a time and era that many have forgotten and fewer have done anything to expose, but Tuff City deserves the credit for blowing the dust off \"Sons of the Father\" and repackaging it, although calling it \"Sons of the Father: Remasteed With Bonus Tracks\" would have been much more honest than calling it \"Best Of.\"  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Yz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
