Through these years they have been considered among the pioneers of Christian rock, and their popularity has not wavered, despite frequent personnel changes. The band's musical style is not totally straight-forward, as it includes a hint of progressiveness.\n\nWhite Heart has never actually stated that they have disbanded, but there hasn't been any consistent musical activity by them as a group since 1997. However, in August 2006 they had a reunion concert at the third annual Soul2Soul Honors event in New Albany, Indiana (Louisville, Kentucky), with the following line-up: Billy Smiley, Rick Florian, Mark Gershmel, Tommy Sims, Jon Knox and Gordon Kennedy.\n\nDiscography (with personnel history):\n\n*WHITE HEART (1982 - Home Sweet Home/Myrrh)\n   *Gary Lunn - bass\n   *Steve Green - vocals\n   *David Huff - drums, percussion\n   *Mark Gershmel - keyboards, synthesizers, vocals\n   *Dann Huff - lead and rhythm guitars, vocals\n   *Billy Smiley - keyboards, rhythm guitars, vocals\n\n*VITAL SIGNS (1984 - Home Sweet Home/Myrrh)\n   *Billy Smiley - piano, acoustic guitar, vocals\n   *David Huff - drums, percussion\n   *Gary Lunn - bass guitars\n   *Mark Gershmel - synthesizers, piano, vocals\n   *Dann Huff - rhythm & lead guitars, acoustic guitar, vocals\n   *Scott Douglas - vocals\n\n*HOTLINE (1985 - Home Sweet Home, Inc)\n   *Gary Lunn - bass\n   *Scott Douglas - lead vocals\n   *Gordon Kennedy - lead guitars, guitars, vocals\n   *David Huff - drums, percussion\n   *Mark Gershmel - keyboards, vocals\n   *Billy Smiley - keyboards, guitars, vocals\n\n*DON'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE (1986 - Sparrow Records)\n   *Ric Florian - lead vocals\n   *Mark Gershmel - keyboards, vocals, trombone\n   *Gordon Kennedy - guitars, lead guitar, sitar, vocals\n   *Gary Lunn - bass, linn programming\n   *Chris McHugh - drums, percussion\n   *Billy Smiley - vocals, keyboards, guitar, trumpet\n\n*EMERGENCY BROADCAST (1987 - Sparrow Records)\n   *Chris McHugh - drums and percussion\n   *Mark Gershmel - keyboards, vocals\n   *Tommy Sims - bass guitar, synth bass, keyboards, vocals\n   *Gordon Kennedy - lead and rhythm guitars, vocals\n   *Billy Smiley - vocals, rhythm guitar\n   *Rick Florian - lead vocals\n\n*FREEDOM (1989 - Sparrow Records)\n   *Mark Gershmel - keyboards and lead vocals\n   *Billy Smiley - guitars and vocals\n   *Gordon Kennedy - guitars and vocals\n   *Tommy Sims - bass and vocals\n   *Chris McHugh - drums\n   *Rikk Florian - lead vocals\n\n*POWERHOUSE (1990 - Star Song Records)\n   *Riq Florian - lead vocals, background vocals\n   *Mark Gershmel - keyboards, lead vocals, background vocals\n   *Mark Nemer - drums and percussion\n   *Anthony Sallee - bass guitar\n   *Billy Smiley - acoustic and rhythm guitars, and background vocals\n   *Brian Wooten - rhythm and lead guitars\n\n*TALES OF WONDER (1992 - Star Song Records)\n   *Ricke Florian - lead vocals, background vocals\n   *Mark Gershmel - keyboards, lead vocals, background vocals, recorder\n   *Billy Smiley - rickenbacker 12-string, hi-string, and 12-string acoustic guitars, background vocals\n   *Brian Wooten - lead guitar, rhythm guitar, gut string guitar\n   *Anthony Sallee - bass, fretless bass\n   *Jon Knox - drums (\"Vendetta\")\n   *Chris McHugh - drums (all tracks except \"Vendetta\")\n\n*HIGHLANDS (1993 - Star Song Records)\n   *Rhic Florian - lead vocals, background vocals\n   *Mark Gershmel - keyboards, percussion, lead vocals, background vocals, recorder\n   *Brian Wooten - rhythm & lead guitars\n   *Anthony Sallee - bass\n   *Jon Knox - drums, percussion\n   *Billy Smiley - rhythm guitars, acoustic & octave acoustic guitars, background vocals\n\n*NOTHING BUT THE BEST - ROCK CLASSICS (1994 - Star Song Records)\n*NOTHING BUT THE BEST - RADIO CLASSICS (1994 - Star Song Records)\n   *Rikcq Florian - lead and background vocals\n   *Mark Gershmel - keyboards, percussion programming, and lead vocals\n   *Jon Knox - drums\n   *Chris McHugh - drums (Climb the Hill)\n   *Mark Hill - Bass\n   *Brian Wooten - guitars\n   *Billy Smiley - guitars and vocals\n\n*INSIDE (1995 - Curb Records)\n   *Rick Florian - lead & background vocals\n   *Billy Smiley - acoustic & electric guitars, background vocals\n   *Mark Gersmehl - organ, piano, synths, lead & background vocals\n   *Brian Wooten - electric & acoustic guitars, lead guitars\n   *John Thorn - electric & acoustic bass, background vocals\n   *Jon Knox - drums, percussion\n\n*REDEMPTION (1997 - Curb Records)\n   *Rick Florian - lead & background vocals \n   *Mark Gersmehl - keyboards, lead & background vocals, loops \n   *Billy Smiley - acoustic & electric guitars, background vocals\n   *Mike Mead (drums) records for this album but continues with other projects\n   *Barry Graul (lead guitar) records for this project but continues with other projects (including lead guitar for DC Talk)\n   *Mark Hill (bass) records for this album but continues with other projects\n\nhttp://www.whiteheart.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/White+Heart\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
