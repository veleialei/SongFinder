Their second most recent release, Danza II: Electric Boogaloo, was issued in 2007 on Black Market Activities. The album's name is a parody of the Danzig album, Danzig II: Lucifuge, as well as the 1980s film Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo. The album features short, humorous skits interspersed with the songs making fun of their surroundings growing up. In March 2008, the band crashed their tour van after playing a show in Lewisville, Texas. Former member Brad Thomson founded Midgets with Machetes, a record label distributed by Uprising Records. The band released their third album, Danza III: The Series of Unfortunate Events, on July 6, 2010. On the record, Josh Travis performs lead and rhythm guitar on an 8-string guitar as well as the bass. It also marks the first album by the band to include drummer Mike Bradley. The songs \"I Am Sammy Jankis\" and \"The Union\" have been released as singles.\n\n\nOn September 24, 2009, the band announced that Layne Meylain and Mike Butler had amicably left the group. At the same time, the band formally announced their next album, Danza III: A Series of Unfortunante Events. The album focuses on lyrical themes such as, personal, social, political and global \"unfortunate events\" tied around three musical themes, technical, groove-based and ambient. It will be recorded in November with Jeremiah Scott and Steve Blackmon.\n\nThe Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza fits right in with today's emerging mathcore heroes, including Ion Dissonance, Ed Gein, The Red Chord, Premonitions Of War, Into The Moat, and Burnt By The Sun. The schizophrenic high-end guitars provide a blanket of psychotic aural assault amidst massive, dense tech breakdowns that will have you slipping, sliding, and dancing every which way. Much like Into The Moat, these guys barrel through one breakdown after the next, successively building on and expanding some of the tightest grooves tech metal has to offer. The bombarding grind-like speeds make a good part of their material sound like Ion Dissonance and Dillinger Escape Plan, while the massive guitar/bass/drum aesthetic using during stop-n-go breakdowns is very similar to Burnt By The Sun. \nThe latest album Danza III shows the bands proficiency at infusing elements of post metal into technical hardcore metal with amazing use of polymetric/polyrythmic technicalities! <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Tony+Danza+Tapdance+Extravaganza\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
