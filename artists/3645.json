(\"Tiny\") Bradshaw (September 23, 1905 – November 26, 1958) was an American jazz and rhythm and blues bandleader, singer, composer, pianist, and drummer from Youngstown, Ohio.After graduating from Wilberforce University with a degree in psychology, Bradshaw turned to music for a living.\nIn Ohio, he sang with Horace Henderson's campus oriented Collegians.Then, in 1932, Bradshaw relocated to New York City, where he drummed for Marion Hardy, the Charleston Bearcats (later the Savoy Bearcats), and the Mills Blue Rhythm Band, and sang for Luis Russell.n 1934, Bradshaw formed his own swing orchestra, which recorded eight sides that year. The band's next recording date was in 1944, at which point its music was closer to rhythm and blues. The band recorded extensively for the rhythm and blues market, especially between 1950 and 1954.\n\nBradshaw's best known recording was \"Train Kept A-Rollin'\" (1951), which passed from rhythm and blues into rock.] The song was recorded by Johnny Burnette in 1956 and The Yardbirds in 1965. It was covered again by Aerosmith in 1974 and by Motörhead in 1978.\n\nBradshaw's later career was hampered by severe health problems, including two strokes that left him partially paralyzed. His 1958 recording, \"Bushes\", proved an unsuccessful attempt to reach out to the emerging teenage market. Weakened by the successive strokes as well as the rigors of his profession, Bradshaw died in his adopted hometown of Cincinnati in 1958. He was 53 years old. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tiny+Bradshaw\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
