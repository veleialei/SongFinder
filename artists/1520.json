It was formed in 2000 in Kingston, Ontario by Marc Garniss, Ben Thomas and Kelly Payne. \n\nAfter numerous line-up changes the band finally had a consistent and solid line-up, this being Marc Garniss, Ben Thomas, Nick Steczkiewicz and Dan Vokey. With this line-up they started touring and writing songs that would later be released on I Hate Sally's 2004 debut Sickness of the Ages. 2005 brought the return of former bassist Dee Prescott back on for vocal duties. With Dee in the line-up, I Hate Sally began recording an EP entitled The Plague which was also released in 2005. In late 2005 Ben Thomas left the band after having issues with the band members. After Ben's departure, I Hate Sally considered starting a new band with the 4 remaining members, but instead decided to continue on as a four-piece I Hate Sally.\n\nIn the spring of 2006 Don't Worry Lady was recorded, and after its completion drummer Nick Steczkiewicz left the band to pursue other options; he was replaced by Mark McGee. Toronto based label Underground Operations signed I Hate Sally in the fall of 2006 and this was followed by the long awaited release of Don't Worry Lady. Vagrant/Density Records signed the band and released Don't Worry Lady in the USA on June 12, 2007, and on October 1, 2007 in the UK. On December 11, 2007 I Hate Sally and Quebec metal band GFK joined forces to release a 6 song split EP. On July 10, 2008, the band officially announced that they had disbanded permanently. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/I+Hate+Sally\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
