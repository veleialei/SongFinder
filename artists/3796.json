He has been featured in the South African music documentary \"Amandla!\" and has lent his vocal skills to the soundtrack of the Academy Award winning South African Film \"Tsotsi\".\nmany in the anti-apartheid movement. His themes include the struggle for freedom, and forgiveness and reconciliation with enemies. Vusi can also be heard performing on Warren Haynes' [Gov't Mule, The Allman Brothers Band] Live at Bonnaroo release during the song \"Soulshine\", and the Dave Matthews Band song, \"Everyday\", from the album of the same name as well as a live version of the song with him which appears on the album The Best of What's Around Vol. 1. Vusi was also one of the performers at the Live 8 concerts.\n\nVusi played a very mellow pre-lunch solo set to an appreciative audience (those capable of functioning at that hour) at the 2004 Falls Festival that was concluded with a superb performance of 'Red Song' in The Big Top, before joining Xavier Rudd on the main Valley Stage to a raptuous reception.\n\nHis album The Voice includes the popular track \"Weeping\", recorded with Josh Groban and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Vusi joined Mambazo for their October-November UK tour in 2004, and will join them again for their 2007 UK tour, again from October to November 2007 [1].\n\nHe and other South African musicians took part in the 2002 documentary Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony where they recalled the days of Apartheid.\n\nIn June 2007, Mahlasela spoke of apartheid and performed \"Thula Mama\" at the TED Conference.\n\nOn 7 July 2007 Mahlasela performed at the South African leg of Live Earth.\n\nHis most recent album, Guiding Star, as Naledi Ya Tsela (the name under which it is released in South Africa) won him the 2007 SAMA for Best Male Artist.\n\n\t\t\nDiscography\nWhen You Come Back\t1992\t\nWisdom of Forgiveness\t1994\t\nSilang Mabele\t1997\t\nLive at the Bassline\t1999\nMiyela Afrika\t2000\t\nJungle of Questions (with the Proud Peoples Band) 2000\nSoundtrack: Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony\t2002\nCompilations: The Voice (Vusi Mahlasela album)\t2003\nSoundtrack: Tsotsi\t2005\nNaledi Ya Tsela (Guiding Star)\t2007\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Vusi+Mahlasela\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
