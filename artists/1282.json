Lack of further chart activity leaves him labeled as a one-hit wonder. However, Knight did appear in the documentary film, Wattstax, which was released in 1973.\n\nAfter Stax's demise Knight launched Juana Records, writing and producing The Controllers, and he had a UK Number 1 chart credit with Anita Ward's \"Ring My Bell\" in 1979. Knight cut \"I've Been Lonely for So Long\" in Birmingham, Alabama, with a seasoned southern soul crew behind him, and hit again in 1975 with \"I Betcha Didn't Know That.\"\n\nThe song \"Be For Real\", written by Knight and originally performed by Marlena Shaw, was covered by Leonard Cohen for his album The Future and subsequently by The Afghan Whigs for the movie Beautiful Girls.\n\nHe only released 4 albums under his name; 1987's \"Knight Kap\" being the last. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Frederick+Knight\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
