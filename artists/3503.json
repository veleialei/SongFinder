They combine the power and punch of traditional R’n’B with great original songs and a show-stopping stage set. They have established a formidable reputation as one of the hardest-working and most charismatic bands in British blues. The band is currently about to record its 6th album for Blues Matters records and was last year nominated for three British Blues Awards.\n\nThe Mustangs are led by the stunning voice and slashing guitar of livewire front man Adam Norsworthy. The razor-sharp rhythm section of Jon Bartley (drums) and Ben McKeown (bass) is one of the tightest on the circuit. The line-up is completed by R’n’B veteran Derek Kingaby on vintage blues harp. \n\n\n2) Riverside, Central CA garage legends! Their 1965 single \"That's For Sure\" is considered one of the Holy Grails of '60s garage rock. That one, hopelessly rare 45 would be their only release. owever, in January 1966 the Mustangs went into Locy Sound in Riverside, California, where they recorded 14 more songs, demonstrating not only their dynamism and versatility as a live cover band, but also their remarkable talent for original material, from wailing rockers to haunting Beatlesque ballads.\n\n3) The mustangs is also a finnish instrumental band. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Mustangs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
