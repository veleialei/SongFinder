Growing up in Humble, Texas, with an abusive, alcoholic father, David found solace in playing the piano. By his mid teens he was touring in Europe and the USA. He went on to study music at the Peabody Conservatory of Music where he met his wife, Debbie, who plays the viola. David worked with Canadian songwriter/producer and Juno Award winner Gino Vanelli for his albums Chronology and Candle In The Rain. David and his wife currently live in Franklin, Tennessee.\n\nPossibly due to his conservatory training, David uses pieces of classical piano works as intros or settings for some of his songs. For example, in the song \"This Time\" from the album Learning to Trust, the opening section of the song (as well as the bridge and ending tag) is from Chopin's \"Revolutionary Etude\" (Op. 10, No. 12) in C minor. The introductory melody for \"You Can Go\", from the album 7, is taken from the Two-Part Invention No. 13 in A Minor (BWV 784) by Johann Sebastian Bach. (Because of the prevalent use of synthesizers, \"You Can Go\" is sometimes incorrectly connected to an advertisement in the early 1980s for Apple Computer used the Bach Invention played by a synthesizer.) Also, \"Falling Down\" from Count the Cost is based on a sonata by Mozart. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Meece\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
