The group's roster originally included Jungle (younger brother of hip hop star Nas) (born Jabari Jones), Wiz (born Mike Epps), and Horse (born E. Gray). Horse left the group in 2002, and Jungle and Wiz carried on as a duo.\n\nSigned to Columbia Records as part of Nas' Ill Will Records imprint, Bravehearts first emerged in 1998, with a track on the soundtrack to the Hype Williams film Belly. From there, the Nas protégés moved on to the QB's Finest compilation album, and saw their track \"Oochie Wally\" go gold. Jungle and Wiz then began working on their full-length debut for Columbia. In the meantime, they appeared on 50 Cent's mixtape-style Guess Who's Back?, supporting 50 and Nas (prior to their beef), on the track \"Who U Rep With.\"\n\nThe debut full-length album Bravehearted was released in December 2003. The album featured guest appearances from Nas, Nashawn, Lil Jon, Jully Black and Teedra Moses, and the group scored a hit single with the Lil Jon-produced track \"Quick to Back Down\". There also may of been a slight diss on 50 Cent on track 5 called \"Bravehearted\" on their album, Jungle also takes a shot at Jay-Z. Jungle states in his verse. \"Jungle will by the moral of the streets not like snitch C.J. or bitch Jay-Z.\"\n\nThe duo is currently working on their second full length LP, to be titled, Cold Black Train. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bravehearts\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
