Many a Beale Street tourist would be surprised to learn that scratching below the surface of the music world there reveals accomplished, successful bands that range from the tech metal and hardcore of Nights Like These to emo and alt-country.\nThe sonic blast Nights Like These delivers is a fusion of the full spectrum of metal, from the complex interplay of Between the Buried and Me to the primal riff assault of Darkest Hour to the unpredictability of The Red Chord. Guitarists Derren Saucier and Matt Qualls seamlessly weave intricate, cacophonic tangents with unrelenting breakdowns. Bassist Sebastian Rios and drummer Patrick Leatherwood provide the framework for the controlled madness that runs the gamut from blast beat-filled death metal intensity to blistering bouts of double bass, wielding their versatility like a weapon. Upon this canvas of chaos, vocalist Billy Bottom opens himself up to paint honest but shockingly intense images. “Most of the songs on the album revolve around losing faith in the world as I personally know it. The lyrics are depressing and most negative but I want kids who sing along to know that there are other dudes out there that feel the same. I want our music to be an outlet for everyone who doesn’t have one.” Billy explains.\nNights Like These has built the largest local following on the heavy scene, regularly playing to packed crowds of super-fans who have memorized every word of their three-song demo. The energy generated from the band‘s live performance is palpable; the stage is all but aflame when this quintet tears through their set list of grinding, unforgiving, heavy metal. \"We play what we want to hear\", says vocalist Billy Bottom, \"and if people like it, that‘s great, if not, then whatever. We definitely have a lot up our sleeve and won’t be stopping anytime soon.\" Nights Like These have shared the stage with some of the best heavy bands out there, from Poison The Well and Bury Your Dead to The Red Chord and Skinless, building a remarkable reputation at an age when many are watching the calendar and waiting to turn 21.\nVictory Records picked up on the buzz from the South and signed Nights Like These in early 2006. The band entered the studio shortly thereafter with Andreas Magnusson, known for his work with Black Dahlia Murder to record The Faithless, their debut album. Named to express their bleak outlet on the world, the band are quick to clarify that it is not a religious or atheistic station. “I have my issues with religion, but this is not an atheist album. It’s about losing faith in almost everything,” commented Bottom.\nWhen asked about their band name, Bottom laughs, and explains, “This band was named after nights that we love. Playing shows, hanging out, when everything is perfect. Nights like these. Self-explanatory.” They are currently on tour bring those truly excellent nights to fans of aggressive music everywhere. The Faithless is in stores now! <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nights+Like+These\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
