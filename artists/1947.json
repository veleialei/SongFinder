Their debut album was released in 2002, shortly after the band’s birth, to ensure them the great pleasure to play live. ♠BUILT FOR SPEED♠, made of 9 mid-paced and heavy tracks, was recorded and mixed in a few days with TVO (Knut, Shora) at the Smelly Room studio in Geneva.\n\nThe band spent 2002 + 2003 playing around with the likes of Sleeppers, Isis, Gojira… Then was the time to let bassist Makro leave for his two main bands Sludge and Samael, to welcome a new young man, Blaise, and start working on a second album.\n\n♣CATTLE TRUCK♣ was “home-recorded” in spring 2004 at Bellefontaine Studio, Lausanne and mixed in three days by Fredrik Nordström (Soilwork, Opeth, At the Gates), then mastered by Peter In de Betou (Dimmu Borgir, Entombed, Nine).\n\nStill on RRRecords, this second effort was released in Europe (with distribution in most western territories) by the end of 2004 and warmly received by many magazines and webzines in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nAfter some cool shows in 2005 with the likes of Dillinger Escape Plan, Unsane and Cult Of Luna and a memorable apparition at the Fury Fest Festival, KRUGER has cooked a new heavy and loaded dose of modern noise metal for their third opus ♣REDEMPTION THROUGH LOOSENESS♣ which was released this spring on LISTENABLE RECORDS.\n\nThe album has been recorded in Lausanne, Switzerland, at Bellefontaine studio by J.Fehlmann and J.Kovaks. The mix was handled by Kurt ballou (Converge, Cave In…) and the mastering by Alan Douches (Mastodon, DEP, Nile).\n\nGloomy and dark, yet overwhelmingly powerful, this new 9-track album drowns the band’s acknowledged influences (Breach, Entombed, Tool, Godflesh, Neurosis) in an intense magma of shredding metallurgic charges, drilling vocal turpitudes and desperate naked heaviness. Thematically still stuck in out-of-subject considerations and cynical bottle stories, KRUGER drive faster and louder, crashing the post-hardcore clichés in their way. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kruger\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
