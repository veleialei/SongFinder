She was in the band \"4 in Love\" (now disbanded). Now she is famous as an actress in Taiwanese dramas, a co-host in the long-running variety show Guess, and a singer for her debut My Intuition.\n\nIn early January 2007, Rainie Yang recorded her last Guess show due to her commitment in filming a new series and releasing a new album.\n\n**Biography\nShe started when she was 14 and started appearing in Hong Kong movies and commercials. At 15, she auditioned for a girlband to be launched by BMG Records called 4 in Love and passed with flying colors. From then on, she was called “Rainie” to fit in with the weather-based named girls; she was originally named Lily. She moved to Taiwan, and pursued her acting career as she lived with her co-band members under one roof. She starred in various dramas starting with the mega blockbuster Meteor Garden where she played a supporting yet pivotal role, the cute Xiao You (Hana Yori Dango’s “Yuki” Chinese counterpart). The rest is history as she proceeded on to be a much-loved leading lady by respectable men and starred in more bankable dramas. Unfortunately, late 2002, for reasons, 4 in Love had to disband. Windie and Sunnie proceeded with their studies and Cloudie pursued to be a stewardess. Rainie was left in the E-circle and now as a solo artist resuming with her career and reaching new heights and levels with a new alternative- as a host. She had discovered her hosting skills with the hosting jobs she did left and right. She did that without wrecking her acting career where she also received many projects. She continued singing by performing on the OSTs of her dramas. 2005 was the breakthrough year for Rainie, her leading TV mini series “Devil Beside You” (恶魔在身边) with Mike He has brought her song Ai Mei a complete success. She holds the record as the first Chinese Newcomer to achieve platinum status in her debut album My Intuition Ai Mei.\n\n**Profile\n    * Nickname: Rainie\n    * Gender: Female\n    * Band: 4 in Love (Disbanded)\n    * Hometown: Taipei, Taiwan\n    * Blood Type: AB\n    * Height: 5' 3\"\n    * Weight: 41kg\n    * Vital Statistics: 32B, 24, 33\n    * Languages: English, Mandarin, Japanese, Taiwanese, Cantonese\n    * Siblings: 1\n    * Talents: Gymnastics, dancing, acting, hosting, singing\n    * Hobbies: Cuddling with her dog (Yumi), reading novels, writing in her journal, sleeping\n    * Occupation: Actress, Former co-host (in the long-running variety show Guess) and singer\n    * Favorite Food: Cookie dough ice cream\n\n\n**Albuns:\n1st \t\tMy Intuition\n(曖昧) Ai Mei\n\n    * Released: September 9, 2005 (Worldwide)\n    * Language: Mandarin Chinese\n    * Label: Sony BMG\n    * Genre: Mandopop\n\n2nd \t\tMeeting Love\n(遇上愛) Yu Shang Ai\n\n    * Released: March 19, 2006 (Worldwide)\n    * Language: Mandarin Chinese\n    * Label: Sony BMG\n    * Genre: Mandopop\n\n\n**TWdramas:\n    *Hi My Sweetheart (2009)\n    * Exchange Love (2007)\n    * Fresh Tomato For Sauce (2007)\n    * Devil Beside You (CTV, 2005)\n    * Liao Zhai Zhi Yi (2004)\n    * City of Sky (CCTV, 2004)\n    * The Legend of Speed (2004)\n    * Tomorrow (2002)\n    * Original Scent of Summer (CTV, 2003)\n    * Love Bird (2003)\n    * Sweet Candy\n    * Godfather in Pink (CTV, 2003)\n    * Lavender 2 (2003)\n    * White Lilies\n    * Tomorrow (2002)\n    * Sunshine Jelly\n    * Meteor Rain (CTS, 2001)\n    * Meteor Garden (CTS, 2001)  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Rainie+Yang\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
