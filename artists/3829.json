Jeff Swanson (drums) of Austin band Gorch Fock is also known to have played when savant soloist Doyle is touring on his own.\n\nMany have said WDRTE were vomited out of the Austin scene because of their various affiliations with other vomit inspired bands. Dinos are made up of members of the following Oh! Beast, Awesome Cool Dudes, Tuxedo Killers, The Dakota Building, Pterodactyl, Twin Powers, Expensive Shit, Daniel Francis Doyle, Shit and Shine, Los Laundry Boys and Wessa DJs (the original Jar Jar Binks DJ duo). \n\nTheir favorite words: clouds, meisters, doggies, pups, brew pups, noiice, noiiiiice, not noiice, nn, n, total meisters, horns up, horns down, no ice, slump busters, wait...what, fritters, beasts and machines.\n\nTheir debut album SNACKS was released by the Emperor Jones Recording Group (also home of The Rebel, Rusted Shut, KB DA KIDNAPPA & Pip Proud).  Their second album NOT NOIICE was released on the Chalk Circle imprint. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/When+Dinosaurs+Ruled+The+Earth\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
