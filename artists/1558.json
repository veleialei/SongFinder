She performs in French, English, and German.\n\n She had one big hit in the 1980s with \"Pull marine\", written especially for her by Serge Gainsbourg, the legendary French singer songwriter, who'd made a habit of writing songs for beautiful actresses (Brigitte Bardot or his partner Jane Birkin). Adjani's singing voice, though extremely thin, is very expressive, her acting prowess clearly helping a great deal. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Isabelle+Adjani\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
