The same year, Shaggy appeared on Kenny Dope's hip hop album \"The Unreleased Project\". He worked together with producers such as Sting Intl., Don One (who cut his first track), Lloyd 'Spiderman' Campbell and Robert Livingston. He had further big hits, including \"Boombastic\" in 1995.\n\nHe then had a major comeback in 2001, featuring worldwide number-one hit singles \"It Wasn't Me\" and \"Angel,\" the latter of which was built around Merrilee Rush's 1968 hit \"Angel of the Morning\" (which was remade in 1981 by Juice Newton). The album Hot Shot, from which those cuts came, would hit number one on the Billboard 200.\n\nHowever, his 2002 release Lucky Day, and the 2005 album Clothes Drop failed to match Hot Shot's success.\n\nShaggy performed the theme for Showtime (film), a 2002 movie.\n\n2, Shaggy, a swedish rock/blues rock band from the 1970's.
