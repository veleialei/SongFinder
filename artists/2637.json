It was eventually made available to the public via downloads on AOL, iTunes, and MusicLoad.\n\nThey decided to shift their work to more of a production and publishing side, while still releasing the occasional single and remix. In 1992 they formed the \"Paso Doble Music Publishing House\". For the sake of their daughter they have worked more at home in Eidelstedt.\n\nRecently, having been off stage for a while, and according to Rale \"Unsere Tochter ist jetzt in einem Alter, in dem sie es genießt, wenn wir mal weg sind\" (\"Our daughter now is at an age, at which she enjoys it, if we are at times away\") and \"Außerdem wollten wir einfach mal wieder auf einer Bühne stehen\" (\"in addition we wanted to simply stand again on a stage\") they released a new 12\" Message Angekommen in 2005. Their 2 most famous songs Computerliebe and Herz An Herz have recently been covered by Das Modul and Blümchen respectively.\n\nReleases\n\n    * Computerliebe (Die Module Spielen Verrückt) (7\")\n    * Computerliebe (Special Disco Version) (12\")\n    * Fantasie (7\")\n    * Fantasie (12\", Maxi)\n    * Herz An Herz (12\")\n    * Herz An Herz (7\")\n    * Magische Nacht (12\" Promo)\n    * Allein Im All (CD, Maxi)\n    * Computerliebe (CD, Album)\n    * Message Angekommen (12\")\n    * Magische Nacht (Download only, Album)\n    * 80er Dance Party\n\nLinks\n\nGerman Links\n\n    * www.paso-doble.com\n    * Basic version of the Official Site\n\nEnglish Links\n\n    * Paso Doble @ Discogs.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Paso+Doble\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
