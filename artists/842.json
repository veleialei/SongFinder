UK Hardcore Punk Band\n2. Belgian Minimal DJ Darko\n3. Italian group\n4. Darko Is A Rapper From New Jersey Also Known As Donnie Darko Of Never So Deep Records\n\n1. Darko (UK Punk Band) \nFull profile http://www.last.fm/music/Darko_Band\n\nWebsite - www.darkoband.com\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/Darkoband?v=info&ref=ts\nEP Download - http://darko.bandcamp.com\n\nDarko are 5 guys shredding hi-octane punk rock for anyone who wants a listen. \n\n\"6 tracks of in your face punk rock\" \n6/10 Rocksound\n\n“With all of the spitfire and West Coast hardcore fervour of bands like A Wilhelm Scream and Strung Out, the lads in Darko churn out gas pedal-to-the-floor anthems on their debut EP. Gang vocals, twin guitar fret-burning and a rhythm section that refuses to quit; Darko is the quintessential heirs apparent to continue on the tradition of melodic hardcore from bands like Death by Stereo and Rise Against.”\n8/10 Push to Fire\n\n“From the start to the end, multiple layers of subtle melodies are woven through the fast paced beats, making it clear that Darko are a band who have embraced the best aspects of hardcore, punk and indeed classic metal and are turning it into their sound.”\n11/13 Room Thirteen\n\n“Hailing from quaint Guilford, melodic hardcore outfit Darko are nothing close to quaint. They are of the hard, fast and loud belief, a belief that many can definitely relate to. The quintet released their powerful self-titled EP at the end of March, and what a beast they've let loose.”\n3.5/5 Alter the Press\n\n“If you like the EpiFat bands of the 90’s check out Darko”\n3/5 Punktastic\n\n2.DARKO (DJ).\nhttp://www.myspace.com/statikdancin\n\nDarko began collecting records while his friends were still playing with toy cars; his selective and demanding ears set to become his most trusted allies.\n\nDJ from the age of 17, Darko has earnt deserved respect on the Belgian music scene. With frequent appearances at the countrys major clubs and dance festivals alongside the likes of Richie Hawtin, Ricardo Villalobos (@ I love Techno), Felix Da Housecat, Erol Alkan, Trevor Jackson, James LCD Murphy, 2 Many DJs. Darko has built a reputation for unshakeable quality, good times guaranteed. With the cheeky twinkle to his seriously-serious-side, he has long been seducing those further a field: in Paris (Nouveau Casino, Batofar, We love,) Berlin (WMF), or London (Fesh Club 333). Appealing directly to the melomaniac within, Darko is a DJ trusted by the hypest fashion circles (Including Louis Vuitton, Sonia Rykiel, Barbara Bui, Xavier Delcour, Antwerp Fashion Academy, La Cambre Mode) and most discerning underground crowds alike.\n\nNo fan of monotony, Darko's sound is eclectic and reflects his open-minded approach to music. His teeth in everything - from minimal to electro, rock or acid - Darko says: \"when you've been a DJ for so long, you eventually laugh at the transience of musical trends and repetitive hype, all that matters is enthusiasm for the timeless and elusive power of music.\n\nThe resolute intuition behind Darkos incisive mixes also guides his artistic programming, to the same simple end: creating space for the artists he wants to see and hear. One foot firmly planted in minimals fertile soil, and the other in electropunk rock nroll, Darko takes care of the needs of many. Creating original platforms for some of the worlds most inspiring artists including, Trevor Jackson, James Murphy, Steve Bug, Luciano, Vive La Fête, or The Radio 4, Darkos projects are each bewitchingly indelible in their own way.\n\nTo satiate his appetite for all things minimal Darko started Statik Dancin. Now in its third year, this hugely popular bi-monthly night shines out with guests including Michael Mayer, Krikor, Tobias Thomas, Losoul, Superpitcher, Jeff Samuel, Koze, Dominik Eulberg, Chloe, Ada, Matias Aguayo, Ferenc, Lawrence, Barbara Morgenstern etc. At Statik Dancin, Darko has successfully cultivated an unmistakable vibe that proves as popular with artists, as with their receptive fans. Bliss and inner sparkle prevail. As minimal booms in Belgium, (he leads his) Statik Dancers (are led) into vast soundscapes to taste emerging delights. Happy people spoilt!\n\nSimultaneously author of unchained technorock mayhem, Darko has recently been electrifying Recyclarts Yeah! nights. Powered by pure punk energy, these are parties with an overdose of attitude. Combining live rock acts and DJ sets, Yeah! slices through genre to release the power of music at its core. Here, as ever, Darko remains: master of the dancefloor - servant to the music.\n\nStill hungry, Darko recently launched Lucy Lee Quality Recordings. The next step in his musical exploration of a certain idea of desire and beauty. Inheriting Darkos sonic schziophrenia, Lucy Lee sets out on a path of cross-pollination, mixing scenes and genre, with personal style. The first signings reveal the bold ambitions of a label that isnt concerned with labels but seeks to shock the senses. First release: The Penelopes Steal This EP (30.01.05) Lucy Lee Quality recordings (www.lucylee.net).\n\n3. DARKO (group)\nDarko is an italian group made by 2 guys : Marco , who writes the songs and Danilo , who plays and sings them.\n\nOfficial Myspace : www.myspace.com/darkofficial\n\n4. Darko aka Donnie Darko\nDEVIL MAY CRY\nBrick City, New Jersey is infamous for its bad air, polluted waterways, corrupt government and crime\nridden communities; but when it comes to Hip- Hop they are a bright light in a sad state of affairs, a gem in the ghetto. This unique city dominated by deprivation has bred some of Hip Hop’s greatest artists, past and present. With Darko’s continued chart success (The single “Summer Time Madness” is the top 5 Added Record in College radio also a Heat seeker on Satellite Radio) and the drive to be the best, he is destined to become part of the Brick City legacy. Donnie Darko is considered the primary catalyst in a rejuvenated Hip Hop movement that is brewing throughout the country. His style (reminiscent of Harlem’s Big L) has captured a new world audience. With DJ Bless’s feverous complex production style combined with Darko’s lyrical synchronization, Brick City can look forward to being\nwell represented in the world of Hip Hop. Donnie Darko’s “Devil May Cry” exclusively produced by DJ Bless\n\nART OF THE DEVIL\nSome people are born to dominate, some are born to control, and some to become superstars, D-Darko was created to do all three. This 19 year old Brick City (Newark, New Jersey) native is causing havoc on the underground Hip- Hop scene. His freshman album release “Darko Effect” (NSD Records/2005) was stamped by the underground Hip- Hop coinsures as one of the best underground albums to be released in 2005/2006. A DJ Bless prodigy, D-Darko has manifested into a lyrical power house. Compared to the late Big L; D-Darko spits raw in your face Hip Hop. If you want to see what growing up in this society is all about, look into D-Darko’s mirror, the reflection will devastate you!\n\nDARKO EFFECT\nNSD has released the long-awaited debut album by Donnie Darko “The Darko Effect”. 16 Tracks of some of the hottest work done by Never So Deep/Suicide Kingz Productionz. I don’t know which is better, the lyrics, flow, or the production. The whole album is “Real Hip-Hop” at its finest. Donnie Darko brings his street experience into play with two bangers “Block Game” and “Gangsta”(featuring Sutter Kain). “Block Game” another Heat Seeking Single puts the listener on the Block with smooth delivery and clever word play. On the track”Gangsta”, Donnie Darko delivers the type of verse that will shut the club down, while Sutter Kain backs him up with his hardcore grimy vocals. DJ Bless is the Executive Producer of this album and brings the underground sound he is famous for. His production, engineering, mixing and mastering skills definitely stand out on this project. With production contributions from 6 Sense and Rain the album is definitely a must have.\n\nhttp://www.neversodeeprecords.com\nhttp://www.ghettometalgear.com\nhttp://www.cdbaby.com\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Darko\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
