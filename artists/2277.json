Two years later, she wrote her first book of poems; Otoño Imperdonable (\"Unforgivable autumn\").\n\nIn 1948, she started travelling, first to the United States and in 1952 to Europe, staying in Paris for 4 years, giving Argentine folklore concerts with Leda Valladares.\n\nBack in Argentina, she wrote TV scripts, plays, and songs for children that have been sung by generations of Argentine children.\n\nHer books and songs, like \"Como la cigarra\" (\"Like the cicada\") often have strong political connotations, as have even some of her work for children, such as \"El Reino del Revés\" (\"The Kingdom of Upside-Down\"), and \"El País del Nomeacuerdo\" (\"The Country of Idontremember\"). \"El País del Nomeacuerdo\" was used as the main song of the Academy Award winning Argentine political-film The Official Story. She was 80 when she died in Buenos Aires on January 10, 2011, after a prolonged battle with bone cancer. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Mar%C3%ADa+Elena+Walsh\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
