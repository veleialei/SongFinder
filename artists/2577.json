The band bears a resemblance to Audioslave. \n\nTheir lead singer, Johnny Strong, is also a MMA fighter, and appeared in the movie Black Hawk Down. In the movie, he played a Special Forces Delta Operator, which is in part how they got their band name. The band is also made up of former Puddle Of Mudd guitarist Paul James Phillips. \n\nRevolver Magazine compare them to, 'Chris Cornell belting for a more radio-friendly Pantera.'\n\nThe second band by that name is a project of Teho Teardo & Scott McCloud from Girls Against Boys. It's a mixture of electronica, punk rock and pop. Dark compositions and the contrary electro-pop-dance both set a real variety in music and Scott McCloud's voice a real pop-tone. \n\nOperator is also an electronic music artist with releases on labels Benbecula and Scandinavia amongst others. The musical style is largely electronica/idm/electro/techno based with occasional vocals.\n\nAnother artist by the name of Operator has released various remixes and original songs for free. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Operator\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
