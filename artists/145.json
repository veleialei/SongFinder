It is no wonder that Anané has been blessed with a deep connection to her own rich history and an immeasurable global understanding of music.  “My aunts and uncles were known as the Xalinos [their family name.]  They made most of the musical instruments on the island, such as guitars, violins, and the uncommon Cavaqinho, a small four-string guitar”, explains Anané.  On the weekends, her family would host the traditional Serenada, a gathering of people who sang and danced to the music of the island.  It was during this time in her childhood that Anané realized the beginnings of her extraordinary vocal prowess.\n\nAfter immigrating to Rhode Island with her family, Anané was able to expand on her musical interests from the island sounds of Cape Verde to the truly diverse and soulful sounds of America.  She has been musically influenced by the artists she grew up listening to, including a wide range of classic and contemporary vocalists such as: Gal Costa, Tito Paris, Sade, and Jill Scott.  “Jill Scott is my greatest inspiration, musically and lyrically.  She is just an all around real woman,” professes the singer/songwriter.  As a result, she has been able to enjoy an eclectic legacy of performers who continually not only impact their listeners but other artists as well, over time.  \n\nTaking her cues from these individuals, Anané began singing in her own musical group, 2 Each Her Own, by the time she was a teen.  “I was in a girl group and we performed in the Rhode Island and Boston area”, she happily reminisces.  “I had always wanted to be involved in the entertainment business, whether it was in modeling, dancing, or singing.”  Anané represented the United States and won the Miss Cape Verde pageant and later won the Miss Portugal title, representing her home state of Rhode Island.  Anané has also taken the modeling world by storm, being featured in such magazines as Latina, Mode, and Ulla Popkens, along with featuring in a major campaign for Revlon.  However, Anané’s multifaceted talents do not simply end with modeling.  She has been designing and sewing her own clothing and coordinating various fashion shows, for years.  Her vast involvement in the entertainment industry has also catapulted her into the music video realm, being featured as a dancer for such artists as: Redman, Erik Sermon, Byron Stingily, and Keith Murray.  Indeed, her experiences as a young world ambassador and performer provided her with the opportunity to travel and begin sharing her extraordinary talents with the world.  \n\n DJ/Producer Louie Vega confesses that “for the past six years, Anané has been my secret weapon muse.”  It is no surprise that Anané’s inclusion in Louie Vega’s new ground-breaking musical project, Elements of Life, was a natural fit and obvious choice. Utilizing various sounds and instruments, along with her sultry lyrics in Cape Verdian, Portuguese, and French, the music on Elements of Life  has been seamlessly blended to truly elevate, enlighten, and even surprise you.  Sharing from her thoughts on this project, Anané says, “It has been one of the most incredible experiences in my life.  Working with Louie Vega…he has this acoustic vision, which is hard to explain…but as each day passed and as we collaborated, little by little, a song came together, like a painting or a poem.  We just let it flow freely.  In the end, we created something that came from deep within our souls…a story that explains what we are feeling at this moment in time, love, and life.”\n\nAnticipation is building on her future projects as she begins yet another chapter in her musical journey with the upcoming release of her first solo album in 2005.  Anané will undoubtedly impact all audiences with her lasting impression and in turn, influence the direction of tomorrow’s music, its artists, and the entertainment industry as a whole.  She is humbly blessed with a beautiful gift of song with an uncommon versatility to create fresh and timeless music stemming from the beats, sounds and emotions of her heart and soul.  Anané is a true musical entrepreneur, who will continue to bring the joy of song to us for many years to come. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Anane\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
