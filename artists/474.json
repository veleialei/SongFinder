With Driscoll and the band, Trinity, he went on to record several hit singles, notably a cover version of David Ackles' \"Road to Cairo\" and Bob Dylan's \"This Wheel's on Fire\", which was featured on Dylan Covered. In 1969 Auger, Driscoll and Trinity appeared performing in the United States on the nationally telecast \"33⅓ Revolutions Per Monkee\".\n\nIn 1970 he formed Brian Auger's Oblivion Express, shortly after abandoning the abortive \"Wassenaar Arrangement\" jazz-fusion commune in a small suburb of The Hague. The Oblivion Express served to cultivate several musicians, including future The Average White Band drummers Robbie McIntosh and Steve Ferrone, as well as guitarist Jim Mullen. Likewise, in 1971 he produced and appeared on Mogul Thrash's only album. Two members of that band, Roger Ball and Malcolm Duncan, would also go on to form the Average White Band.\n\nIn 1989, Auger was musical director for the thirteen-part film retrospective series \"Villa Fantastica\", made for German TV. A live recording of the series, Super Jam (1990), features Auger on piano, Pete York on drums, Dick Morrissey on tenor saxophone, Roy Williams on trombone, Harvey Weston on bass guitar, with singers Zoot Money and Maria Muldaur.\n\nAuger toured with blues rocker Eric Burdon in the early 1990s, and recorded the live album Access All Areas with him in 1993. After several projects, including albums with family members, he reformed the Oblivion Express in the late 1990s, with a line-up that eventually featured both his son and daughter.\n\nThe Oblivion Express was revived with a 2005 recording and subsequent touring. The group featured Brian Auger, his son Karma Auger on drums, his daughter Savannah Auger on vocals, and Derek Frank on bass.\n\nwww.brianauger.com/indexba.asp\n\nwww.brianauger.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Auger%27s+Oblivion+Express\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
