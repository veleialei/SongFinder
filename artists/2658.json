However, he soon started his career as an orchestral arranger on various hit songs, including David Bowie's \"Space Oddity\" (1969), and contributed orchestral collaborations on a number of early albums by Elton John (1969-72) and on The Rolling Stones' album Sticky Fingers (1971).\n\nBuckmaster also helped Miles Davis with the preparation of On the Corner (1972). He wrote the arrangements for the studio sessions, in which he also participated, at Davis' request, by humming bass lines and rhythms to lead the musicians. The arrangements he wrote were often used as a starting point to be transformed until what was being played bore no resemblance to what he had written. This was in keeping with the Stockhausian approach that Buckmaster had been discussing with Davis in the weeks leading up to the session.\n\nBuckmaster also played with Bowie and his band on the recordings for the original soundtrack to the science fiction film The Man Who Fell to Earth, in which David Bowie starred as Thomas Jerome Newton. Buckmaster himself told in the book 60 Years of Bowie that he had played cello on the original soundtrack recordings. Also Carlos Alomar, J. Peter Robinson and others were involved. Buckmaster: \"There were a couple of medium tempo rock instrumental pieces, with simple motifs and rifly kind of grooves, with a line-up of David's rhythm section (Carlos Alomar et al.) plus J Peter Robinson on Fender Rhodes and me on cello and some synth overdubs, using ARP Odyssey and Solina. There was also a piece I wrote and performed using some beautifully made mbiras (African thumb pianos) I had purchased earlier that year, plus cello, all done by multiple overdubbing.\" Later film-director Nicolas Roeg decided not to use the recordings but existing songs as soundtrack for the movie.\n\nBuckmaster also wrote some instrumental tracks for the 1974 Harry Nilsson film Son of Dracula, and composed the original score for Terry Gilliam's science fiction hit 12 Monkeys (Universal, 1995), which starred Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt.\n\nBuckmaster won the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s) for Drops of Jupiter.\n\nSelected discography\n\nYear\tArtist\tSong\tAlbum\tNotes\n2016\tMax&Friends\t\"Dove c'è amore\"\n\"Arrivi Tu\"\n\n\"Acqua\"\n\n\"Sabato Sera\"\n\n\"Una parte del tutto\"\n\n\"Felice\"\n\n\"Terra mia\"\n\nMax&Friends\tCo-composer\nArranger\n\n2016\tIdina Menzel\t\"Extraordinary\"\n\"Show Me\"\n\"Everybody Knows\"\n\"Small World\"\n\"I Do\"\n\"I See You\"\n\"Like Lightning\"\n\"Last Time\"\tidina.\tArranger\n2016\tHeart\t\"I Jump\"\n\"City's Burning\"\n\"Sweet Darlin\"\n\"Language of Love\"\tBeautiful Broken\tArranger\n2015\tThe Tenors\t\"I Remember You\"\tUnder One Sky\tArranger\n2014\tHunter Hayes\t\"...interlude\"\tStoryline\tArranger/Conductor\n2014\tFerras feat.
