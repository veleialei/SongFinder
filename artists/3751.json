Brown), is an English recording artist, songwriter and producer signed to Universal's Island Records in the UK and to EMI's Capitol Records in the USA. The “Los Angeles Times” and UK newspaper “The Independent” have both named Brown an artist to watch in 2009.\n\nAfter spending a difficult couple of years in Los Angeles, singing backing vocals and dating an idiot, Brown decided that she had had enough of America and returned home to London. She left her useless American boyfriend behind and decided to start anew. She bought a one-stringed guitar from a second-hand shop, and rented a tiny attic in east London. Within half an hour, she had written her debut single, Crying Blood, about a relationship meltdown.\n\nVanessa Brown released her debut album, Travelling Like the Light, in July 2009 by Universal Records. The album was preceded by limited non-chart eligible releases of Crying Blood and Leave!, as well as a third single entitled Shark in the Water, which peaked at #34 in the UK Singles Chart, making it her most successful single to date. \n\nBrown wrote the music and plays instruments on the album. It is inspired by 1950s and electronic music as well as sounds emitted from Game Boy and Nintendo. Most of the lyrics on the album are about a failed affair Brown endured. On 5 December 2008, she was nominated for the BBC's Sound of 2009 award, alongside acts including Little Boots and Lady GaGa.\n\nA fourth single, game over, was released in September 21, 2009.\n\nThe first single from Brown's second album was titled Children and was released to US iTunes on September 20 2011.\n\nSites: Discogs, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook & http://vvBrown.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/VV+Brown\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
