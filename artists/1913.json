Kira was born in the town of Rødovre (Denmark), and became interested in classical music through her aunt and uncle, both of whom are musicians.\nWhen she was ten years old, her parents divorced, which was difficult for her. About this time, she became interested in rock music, and so she tried to learn to play the guitar. This did not go well, however, as she did not have enough patience for it, and so she began singing instead.\nIn 1993 she went to London, where she met a guitarist called Eve, who she followed to the United States. Together with Eve and—amongst others—Laust Sonne, she formed a band called Butterfly Species, which existed until 1999. When Butterfly Species split, she left Eve and travelled back home to Denmark.\nIn 2001, she received a scholarship from Denmark's national arts foundation the Statens Kunstfond, which made it possible for her to concentrate on writing songs, and in 2002 she founded the band Kira & The Kindred Spirits.\nOver the course of existence of the band from 2001 to 2007, the group became known as a good live band, with Kira as its dynamic powerhouse. They released three albums in the process. In October 2007 it was announced that Kira & The Kindred Spirits had split up and that Kira would pursue a solo career.\nWhile in the band, Kira became well known for singing a duet with Lars H.U.G. at Rock 'N' Royal in 2004 just before the wedding between Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary.\nKira Skov continued with a solo musical career in collaboration with Nicolai Munch Hansen from her former band. She released a soloalbum in 2008 called \"The Rail Train, The Meadow, The Freeway and The Shadows\"  Her latest releases includes the Billie Holiday tribute \"Memories of Days Gone By\" (2011) and after that came the also acclaimed \"When We Where Gentle\" (2013).\n\nInfo on Kira Skov: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kira_Skov\nSee more about Kira:at www.kiramusic.com\n\n2) Kira (Germany) was born Janine Scholz in Wuppertal, Germany on October 20, 1978.  At the age of ten she started studying the violin, but after six years of lessons, she decided she wouldn't get very far with the violin and wanted to write her own songs.  She subsequently got a job at a metalworks plant, earning enough money to buy her first guitar, with which she started writing pop songs, often dedicating herself more to her music than to her schoolwork.  When she submitted one of her early songs to a home recording competition in 1997, it caught the attention of Hamburg-based producer Michael Hagel.  She moved to Hamburg in 2000 and got the EMI-based label Grönland interested in her music.  In November 2002 she met the label's founder, Herbert Grönemeyer, a singer in his own right and an actor perhaps best known in North America for his role as Lieutenant Werner in the movie \"Das Boot\".  Kira released her first album, \"Inauswendig\", in October 2004 and her second, \"Goldfisch\", in August 2006.  From these she has released several singles, including \"Der Sog\", \"Alte Frauen\" (her cover of a Buju Banton song called \"Untold Stories\"), \"Wenn du den Himmel nicht aufmachst\" and \"Nie zu Hause\".  Though she also speaks English, she has recorded primarily in German, though she has recently recorded some songs in Chinese as a result of two tours in November 2008 and June 2009.  She is currently working a third album, which is due out this fall; of the songs intended for it, some are already available on an EP she released in March 2009, called \"Deine Insel\" (Your Island).\n\nFor the Janine Scholz site, see http://www.kira-online.net (she also has a fan website at www.kirafans-online.net) \n\n3) The above singers should not be confused with the Kira responsible for the single \"I'll Be Your Angel\".  This Kira is a Belgian model whose real name is Natasja de Witte.\n\nFor the Natasja de Witte site, see http://www.geocities.com/natasjadewitte/kira.html .  \n\n4) A fourth Kira, about whom not much is yet known, has her web site at http://kira.net .\n\n5) Japanese singer KIRA (ＫＩＲＡ). kiranomahou.net\n\n6) In the Death Note anime , there is KIRA called killer. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Kira\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
