In a bit more than 5 years, Vuneny has played more than 500 concerts in 25 European countries, made 3 movie soundtracks, 3 albums, created or co-created several multimedia projects & remixes, and became one of the most productive and creative collectives in the region.Vuneny composes music that has characteristic atmosphere with a sound that is both expressionistic and scenario-like. It’s projects are based on a dynamic work in progress often developed in collaboration with other artists and through different creative forms.\n\nVUNENY was founded by musicians Andrijan Zovko (keyboard and machines in electro-core band Handle With Care) and Nedim Cisic (guitar in dark-pop band Mara, and one of the founders of Mostar based Alternative Institute and Kolaps publishing), following a proposal by Mostar Short Film Festival to create a soundtrack for \"Le Revelateur\" – a cult mute film by Phillipe Garell from 1968. Later that year the guitarist and percussionist Asmir Sabic, (ex Alternativa Nova and Ultrared Orchestra) joined a newly established electro-acoustic trio VUNENY. In the beginning of 2008 Asmir leaves the band. Later that year Vuneny signed a contract for a new release with Jarring Effects, French electro dub record label, and their third album \"Whatever Singularity\" was released in March 2009. \n\nDiscography:\n - Play that Silence - Buybook (BiH), 2004, Zvuk Mochvare (HR), 2004\n - V2 - Moonlee Records (SLO, HR), Buybook (BiH), 2006\n - \"Whatever Singularity\" - Jarring Effects (FR), 2009\n\n-------------------------------------------\nhttp://www.myspace.com/vuneny\n-------------------------------------------\n\n„Tool gone dub.“ US,NYC Stylus magasine  http://www.stylusmagazine.com \n\n“Post-Modern Post-Dadaist Balkan Space Aged Film Music.„ UK, Subba cultcha\nhttp://www.subba-cultcha.com/article_album.php?id=4941\n                                                                                   \n„Listening to these songs, I often begin to imagine films that don’t exist. It’s not always a pleasant film but the soundtrack is excellent - dark, threatening electronic music, lead by gloomy guitars.“ UK, Indigo flow                            http://www.indigoflow.co.uk/2007/04/24/venuny-v2/\n\n„Dark unconfortble fusion, straight from the heart of the Balcans.“ Big cheese, UK                                                                                                                    http://www.bigcheesemagazine.com/\n\n„The bastard son of electro-pop and alternative rock, the mix of guitars and synth had me on the edge of my seat wondering what was coming next. Chilled to the point of being horizontal whilst displaying some of the most creative mixing I’ve heard in years, this is a crossover worth bearing notice of.“   Die shellsuit die, UK                                                                                                          http://www.dieshellsuit.co.uk/article_detail.asp?rID=1170\n\nThis lengthy affair (14 tracks in about an hour) proves to be an incredibly unique and intriguing set of songs that superbly mesh all sorts of electronics and programming with guitars and sparse vocal manipulations to create a vastly experimental and atmospheric tone that really does defy categorization in my opinion.
