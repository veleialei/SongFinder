He had his first accordion at age 12, which he played at parties, weddings and other events with his father and uncle.\n\nA musical-talent TV show that travelled around small towns opened the door for Spasiuk to perform at provincial festivals. When he finished high school, he went to Posadas, capital of Misiones, to study anthropology, but soon after dropped out. Nevertheless, there he was exposed to other musical genres, and met pianist Norberto Ramos, who convinced him to go to Buenos Aires to study with him. Spasiuk then played in small places in Buenos Aires as well as in some festivals around the country, and even received an invitation to participate of the Eurolatina festival in the Netherlands.\n\nIn 1989 El Chango was invited to play in Cosquín, perhaps the most important folkloric music festival in Argentina, where he received the \"Consecration\" prize. After Cosquín he moved to Buenos Aires, where he recorded his first album, eponymously named Chango Spasiuk.\n\nSpasiuk gained some popularity not only among folk and world music audiences but, given his modern style, also with rock and pop fans. He worked as a guest musician with bands like Divididos and Cienfuegos, but continued recording his own material. Favourable reviews of the \"La Ponzoña\" album reached Canada, and El Chango was invited to play at the Montreal International Jazz Festival.\n\nIn 2000 he returned to his roots recording Polcas de mi tierra live at parties and weddings in the small towns of Misiones with his accordion. Since then he has being touring around the world with the Chango Spasiuk Orchestra, and has edited an international recompilation of his work in 2003.\n\nSpasiuk has been championed in Europe by world music journalists, for many of whom chamamé is a previously unknown form of music. BBC radio presenter Charlie Gillett is a prominent fan in the United Kingdom and has included El Chango's tracks on his compilations and playlists.\n\nDiscography\n\nChango Spasiuk (1989) \nContrastes (1990) \nBailemos y...
