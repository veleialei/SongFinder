In June 2008, Payne announced her retirement from the group, in order to spend more time with her husband and four children.\n\n\nIn 1998, they added a touring band, with Cappillino's husband, Dana, and Tommy McGee as permanent band members on guitar and on bass, respectively.\n\n\nIn 2006, former Avalon member Michael Passons added his work to the group's live show, usually opening the set with a few solo songs and backing the group on keyboards.\n\n\nThe group's debut self-titled album was released in 1993; since then, they have been recognized as one of the top Contemporary Christian music bands in the United States. In 2003, they released their ninth album, 24 - a compilation of their 24 consecutive #1 radio singles. To this date, no band in any genre has matched this record. As of 2006 the girls have 27 #1 radio singles.\n\n\nThe group has started a conference for young girls, the Girls of Grace series <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Point+Of+Grace\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
