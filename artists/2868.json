From 1992 until his departure in 2007, he was the lead singer of the group Lonestar, which recorded seven studio albums on BNA Records during his tenure as lead vocalist. McDonald co-wrote several of the band's singles, and sang lead on all but one of them. Outside the band, he charted twice as a guest vocalist on others' songs, in addition to releasing two independent albums and four solo singles. In late 2011, it was announced that he will reunite with Lonestar for their 20th anniversary. \n\nIn addition to his career with Lonestar, McDonald sang harmony vocals on Mindy McCready's 1997 single \"Maybe He'll Notice Her Now\". He has also co-written four singles for other country music artists, including \"She's Always Right\" by Clay Walker, \"Let Them Be Little\" by Billy Dean (which was also recorded by Lonestar), \"Coalmine\" by Sara Evans, and \"Once a Woman Gets a Hold of Your Heart\" by Heartland.\n\nMcDonald announced his departure from Lonestar in 2007, with Cody Collins succeeding him as the band's lead vocalist. On November 8, 2007, Richie released an album of Christmas music, titled If Every Day Could Be Christmas. Also featured on the new album is \"Coming Home for Christmas,\" a collaboration with Jim Brickman.\n\nMcDonald released his solo debut album I Turn to You on June 3, 2008. He signed a deal with Stroudavarious Records a month later. His first single for the label, \"How Do I Just Stop\", was released in November, but did not chart until the week of January 17, 2009, where it debuted at number 53 on the Hot Country Songs chart and peaked at 51. A second single, \"Hey God\", which was originally on his I Turn to You album and before that on Lonestar's 2006 album Mountains, was released on March 3, 2009, but was withdrawn from country radio and replaced with \"Six Foot Teddy Bear.\"\n\nMcDonald released Slowdown, his second solo album, in 2010. This album included \"How Do I Just Stop\", which also peaked at number 51. \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Richie+McDonald\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
