These pupils got together at the weekends to use their very basic equipment for falling in love with passion for making their own electronic music.  Two cheap synths a borrowed drumcomputer and two cheap guitars as well. By the way one of the guitars turned out to sound better if used as a percussion instrument...\n\nA friend of DDS took an early session tape (in this time recording was done by dubbing from one stereo tape deck to another one...) to THE PLACE in Augsburg an independent club called RUDI'S SLIP and from that day on the DJ and owner of this club played the DDS song, The Style, day by day.\n\nDriven by this absolutely new experience that someone else likes their music too DDS finished their first tape at the end of 1984 called,”First Wave, (manufactured by themselves  that got sold for DM 3,- to some of their friends (there are only 33 original tapes  worldwide!!!).\n\nAt the beginning of 1985 DDS had their first live gig at Neon in Augsburg. As time passed by two more tapes appeared (Help Edition Ltd. and Move Your Body) and the equipment got better and better. In 1987 Marc H. Buchner added his brilliant voice to the band and became the front man of the band. Electric Current” was the first tape where Marc´s voice could be heard. The next tape was also the last in DDS´s history: Undressed(more than 200 sold in the local area).\n\nWith Fashion a song from the tape Undressed DDS got a deal at the ZYX Music” label, where the first professional release (produced by Luca Anzilotti and Michael Münzing, later SNAP) called ”Fashion” got released in 1989 under the band name no name. After this they got signed by CBS (later Sony Music) under the name O.I.C. (oh, I see) and the single You Hurt Me” was short to be released, when the influence in O.I.C.´s music of this major company and the executive producer grew to an extent where the songwriters Veit and Harald couldn´t take it any longer: They founded their own label !NTELLIGENT COMMUNICATIONS and left the major company carrying on with their mega-stars heading for the profit (which is something they´re undoubtedly very good at ...).\n\nOn this label finally DDS gets all the support and respect to be what DDS  always wanted to be: A simple electronic pop band with all their strength and weaknesses but finally honest in what they do!\n\nThey released ”The Phone Call”-MCD in 1993 and ”Secret Words & Little Treasures”-CD in 1994 and got excellent resonance.\n\nSince on !NTELLIGENT time is no longer an issue for DDS and during several years of work in the studios one thing is for sure: DDS will be there in the future for a long, long time – they promise!\n\nIn 2000 DDS released a re-worked version of “Fashion” on an EP with some newer tracks. An US release on Synthphony Records “Fashion limited EP” appeared at the same time with slightly different mixes/tracks. The next “biggie” for DDS has been their new full lenght album CD “then-now-forever” released 2001.\n\nIn the time between 2006 and late 2007 Dark Distant Spaces recorded a new 13-track album “Dark Like My Soul” which got released early 2008. So far their strongest work from what the feedback on this release says. \n\n \n \n \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Distant+Spaces\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
