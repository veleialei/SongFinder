jobs and worked in the theatre, journalism and 'any other damn job that will pay the rent.' \n\nHe lives in Somerset where he enjoys spending as much time as possible outdoors, looking after animals and creating a garden with 'anything you can eat; it's better to grow food, for yourself and whatever flies by.'\n\nIn the 1970's Chris made two records for Billy Gaff and David Geffen and these albums have now achieved cult status. In the 1980s Chris worked as a lyricist with Franck Langolf and contributed to two Stones albums (Dirty Work and Steel Wheels).\n\nIt was as recently as 1994 with the release of 'Atcha' (Rock the Zydeco in the USA) that Chris established his musical identity and plotted a course that he is still pursuing. That course combines CJ's interest in Zydeco, Cajun and Country with the underlying strands of R'n'B, Rock and World music. Constant touring has enabled Chris to hone his skills as frontman and vocalist. In his band he also plays guitar and washboard.\n\nIn 1996 Chris recorded an acoustic album with long term associates Ben Waters and Charlie Hart and there followed the current album 'Channel Fever' with full line-up.\n\nChris still has current acoustic projects and in 2002 toured the UK with fiddle player Robin Mckidd playing clubs and theatres.\n\nRecently Chris, Charlie Hart and Ben Waters appeared on BBC Radio 3 'the Andy Kershaw show' and Radio 4's Ned Sherrin arts programme 'Loose Ends.' <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Jagger\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
