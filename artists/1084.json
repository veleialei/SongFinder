It was recorded in Estudio Insular and mastered in Eduardo Bergallo’s studios in Buenos Aires, by mastering engineer Max Scenna, who has worked with several famous artists, Gustavo Cerati being one of them.  \n\nHis first release was the official single for “Nadar en el asfalto” along with its promotional video directed by José Aguirre Maldavsky, which features the well-known Chilean actor Tomas Verdejo, from the TV series “Los 80”.\nDuring February and the beginning of March 2015 he did extensive touring in Europe, having gigs in Madrid and Bilbao in Spain, Ortuella in Basque Country and finally Paris and Montpellier in France, where he shared the stage with the band Sonic Angel (Montpellier).\n\nWhile in Paris he recorded a promotional video for his second single “Deja desastres”, which was recorded by the renowned Chilean director J.G. Biggs, who is now residing in France. He has worked with other artists such as Culture Club, Katy Perry, Saian Supa Crew and Nina Simone among many others. \n\nDuring May 2015 he released his third single “Somos 3” along with a video documenting his European tour. \nBy the end of September he toured several cities of México as the support guitarist for the Chilean band “Tenemos Explosivos”. He also had the chance to showcase his album in several Aztec clubs.  \n\nThe band’s line-up for extended live shows is composed of Rodrigo Millán (Drums, backing vocals), David Silva (Bass), José Aguirre (Guitar, keyboards) and Eduardo Fernández (vocals, guitar). The album is available in digital format through the national label Sudamerican Records, in Spotify and iTunes.  \n\nEduardo is currently creating his second album to be released 2016, which will be followed by a new tour called #PuñalTour that will start in Vancouver (CA) and continue to Seattle, Portland and Olympia (US).\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n- Eduardo Fernández - one of today's leading guitarists - is born in 1952 in Uruguay.\nHe began his studies of guitar at age 7. His principal teachers were Abel Carlevaro, Guido Santórsola and Héctor Tosar. \n\nRewards in Competitions:\n* 1972 Porto Alegre (Brazil) \n* 1975 Radio France (Paris) \n* 1975 Andrés Segovia Competition in Mallorca (Spain). \n\nHis New York debut in 1977 won critical accolades. Fernández has returned to the U.S.A. every season since then, playing with prestigious orchestras as well as giving recitals, always to great acclaim from critics and audiences. His London debut, in Wigmore Hall (1983), had also a great impact. It resulted in an exclusive recording contract with Decca, a label for which he made 18 recordings (solos, and with the English Chamber Orchestra and the London Philharmonic), that cover a wide section of the repertoire, from Bach to the contemporary.\n\nHe has also made a recording with violinist Alexander Markow, covering most of Paganini's work for violin and guitar, and two duo CDs with Japanese guitarist Shin-Ichi Fukuda in Japan. He has recorded the complete lute suites by Bach and \"Romantic Guitar\" a 19th-century guitar recording on a period instrument. In 2005 was the release of the CD \"Between two worlds\".\n\nFernández has also played, with the same success, in most European countries, and in the Far East (Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong and China, Thailand and Singapore), as well as in South America and Mexico.\n\nHe has a vivid interest in historical instruments, and he plays often the repertoire of the XIXth century on a period guitar.\n\nAs a teacher he taught several years at the University's School of Music in Montevideo, where he is now a fellow researcher and gave masterclasses and lectures all around the world. \nHe has written a major book on guitar technique (Technique, Mechanism, Learning, published by Chanterelle Verlag, Heidelberg and in Spanish edition by ART Ediciones, Montevideo), a book of essays on Bach's lute music, published in 2003 by ART Ediciones, and several articles in leading guitar publications.\n\nHe was the secretary of ISCM Uruguay for two years. He is also a founder the CIM/UNESCO section in Uruguay, Artistic Director of Montevideo's biannual International Guitar Festivals since 1996, and of Colombia's Encuentros Nacionales de la Guitarra since 2000. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Eduardo+Fern%C3%A1ndez\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
