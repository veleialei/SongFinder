The only recorded trace of his activities is a session he did with the legendary trumpet player Red Rodney for the Prestige label in 1951. According to the liner notes, Phil Raphael also played in Tommy Dorsey and Stan Kenton’s big bands – although there is no recorded proof of this – and moved to Las Vegas for a while. It is unknown exactly when he appeared on the Belgian scene, nor when he disappeared from the musical life of Brussels, but he did play at the Pol’s club where his wife worked as a cloakroom assistant during the 1970s. The recording session for ‘Stop, Look, Listen’ took place on 3rd June 1972 and although the character and story of the leader remain a mystery, his Belgian accompanists were well-known figures on the Brussels scene. Drummer Robert Pernet, vibraphone player and percussionist Johnny Perret and double bass player Paul Dubois played and recorded with Toots Thielemans, Bobby Jaspar and many others for thirty years or so. Unfortunately, Paul Dubois, the only surviving member of the rhythm section, who played just this once with the pianist, has no memory of Raphael or of the opera singer Rose Thompson, whose voice lights up the arrangements. However, the real mystery surrounding this album - even more than the circumstances in which it came into existence - is the magical nature of the compositions. Raphael manages to create a unique alchemy on every track, a harmonious blend of very different musical styles: be-bop, opera, free jazz, and rock. Many musicians tried their hand at fusion around that time, but this album is unequalled in its lyrical, poetic chemistry. Stop, look, listen… \n\n2) Raphaël Haroche, born on 7 November 1975 in Paris France, is a French singer who performs under the name Raphael. His father is Russian and his mother is from Argentina. \n\nHe began his public career with the song \"Cela Nous Aurait Suffi (Dayenou)\", featured on his critically-acclaimed debut album Hôtel de l'Univers in 2001. His first major public hit was \"Sur La Route\", a duet with French long-time rock legend Jean-Louis Aubert. His second album, La Réalité (2003), was met with successes both critical and commercial, and Raphael has been on the road ever since, playing gigs all over France. After the release of super-hit album Caravane, best-selling French LP of 2005 helped by catchy-yet-thought-provoking tunes such as \"Caravane,\" \"Ne Partons Pas Fâchés,\" \"Et dans 150 ans,\" or \"Schengen\", he went on to win three 'Victoires de la Musique'.\n\nHis current partner is Mélanie Thierry (actress and model). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Rapha%C3%ABl\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
