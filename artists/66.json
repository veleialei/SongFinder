A.O.D.'s first recordings saw release on the widely distributed New York Thrash cassette compilation released on ROIR cassettes in 1982. The compilation also featured the first recordings of the Beastie Boys, as well as prominent NYC punk bands like the Bad Brains and Kraut. The comedic and speedy \"Paul's Not Home\" became an instant college radio hit.\n\nA.O.D.'s first vinyl record, a 6 song 7\" EP entitled Let's Barbeque, was released on their own Buy Our Records label in 1983. Because the budget was so tight, the band could only afford 15 minutes of studio time. They recorded all six tracks in one take with no overdubs. Buy Our Records became one of New Jersey's largest indie punk labels and springboarded the careers of many bands including Flag Of Democracy, Raging Slab, and Pussy Galore.\n\nAdrenalin O.D.'s first album entitled The Wacky Hijinks of Adrenalin O.D. showcased the band's use of blazing speed-punk and sarcastic lyrics, taking aim at the suburban experience with songs like \"Middle Aged Whore\", \"Trans Am\" (the inspiration for the Dead Milkmen's \"Bitchin' Camarro\"), and the crowd favorite \"Rock n' Roll Gas Station\". The album contains an untitled and blatantly obvious backmasked track. When played backwards, it is the band members saying in unison; \"God is very, very nice. Be kind to animals. Satan sucks.\"\n\nAdrenalin O.D. toured nationally and created a loyal following via their live shows (described by some as an experience somewhere between Minor Threat and Don Rickles.) The band's quick wit and on-stage banter was at times as much of an improv stand-up comedy act as a hardcore punk band, and fans coined the term \"funny-punk\" to describe their performances. Tracks that exhibit the band's quirky sense of humor include a punk rock cover of Henry Mancini's \"Baby Elephant Walk\", a surf rock version of \"Hava Nagila\" entitled \"Surfin' Jew\", and a track entitled \"Masterpiece\" which is a punk reworking of Jean-Joseph Mouret's 'Rondeau\" from \"Symphonies and Fanfares for the King's Supper\" (which the band knew only as the theme from the PBS TV series Masterpiece Theatre).\n\nBy their third release Cruising With Elvis In Bigfoot's UFO, the band brought in producer Daniel Rey (who had worked with the Ramones, Misfits and Iggy Pop) to help the band's translation from hyper-speed to mid-tempo melodic punk. With songs like \"Bulimic Food Fight\", and \"My Mom Can't Drive\", Stereo Review Magazine ranked the album among the funniest records of all time, and the album was formative in the development of the pop punk sound of Fat Wreck Chords. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Adrenalin+O.D.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
