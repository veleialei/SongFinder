That's why many instruments from all origins and all ages are played: hurdy-gurdy, arabic lute, violin, bouzouki, bagpipes, chalemie, mandolin, portable organ, bombarde, various flutes, and other stringed instruments.\n\nThe band signed up with Holy Records after the demo \"Ode Aux Lointains Souverains\" (1995) which was very successful, and released its first album \"Hantaoma\" in 1997: this CD offers an acoustic music of traditional and medieval influence whose concept is based on Pyrenean mythology (pantheon, spirits, legends etc)\n\nThe second album \"Ex-uvies\" came out in 1998 and presents an obscure music which is more electric while still keeping acoustic parts and some bewitching laments. The band apprehends paganism as an intuition or something surreal.\n\n\"Satyre Cornu\" was released in June 2001 and rests on a very energic and medieval style, an orgiastic and mystic atmosphere punctuated with the language of 12th century troubadours revived but this most unusual music (it contains Occitan cover of Iron Maiden's To Tame A Land).\n\nIn June 2003, the fourth album was realeased, called \"Maudat\". According to the artistic tradition of the band, this is a conceptual album about a sorceress who travels into a phantasmatical universe full of myths, visions and legends. This is a fantastic ride into a universe of various instruments which declaim their madness, a tragic and festive nocturnal dance, a mythical past filled with incredible melodies, overexcited ambiances jumbled wtih emotional moments. Middle Ages and celtic music uniquely recreated by this fantastic band. A magic awaits to take your soul while listening to these telluric songs. Maudat is their newest album, a bewitching mix of lively tunes and dark laments. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stille+Volk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
