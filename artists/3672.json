In the early days of British psychedelia, three bands were consistently cited as first-generation figureheads of the London-based underground sound: Pink Floyd, the Soft Machine, and Tomorrow. Pink Floyd became superstars and the Soft Machine influential cult legends, but Tomorrow is mostly remembered (if at all) for featuring Steve Howe as their lead guitarist in his pre-Yes days. Actually, Tomorrow was nearly the equal of the two more celebrated outfits. Along with the early Floyd and Soft Machine, they shared a propensity for flower-power whimsy. Though they were less recklessly innovative and imaginative, their songwriting was accomplished, with adroit harmonies, psychedelic guitar work, and adventurous structures and tempo changes. They never succumbed to mindless indulgence or jamming; indeed, their tracks were rather short and tightly woven in comparison with most psychedelic bands.\n\nBand members were Steve Howe (electric and acoustic guitars), Keith West (vocals), John \"Junior\" Wood (bass guitar) and John 'Twink' Alder (drums). Tomorrow singer Keith West is perhaps better known as a participant in Mark Wirtz's Teenage Opera project that gave him a solo hit single \"Excerpt from a Teenage Opera (Grocer Jack)\" and brief commercial success. Guitarist Steve Howe later joined progressive rock band Yes and then Asia, whilst Twink joined The Pretty Things on their concept album, S.F. Sorrow, before forming The Pink Fairies.\n\nTomorrow are credited with releasing the first psychedelic single, 'My White Bicycle'. Tomorrow's September 1967 single \"Revolution\" was likely the primary inspiration for the John Lennon song Revolution which was released a year later.[citation needed] Tomorrow's lyric \"Have your own little revolution, NOW!\" sounds like it prompted Lennon's response \"You say you want a revolution.\" Though Tomorrow's song was not a hit the group was well known to insiders of the London music scene. Frank Zappa met the group on his first trip to England in 1967 and praised Steve Howe's guitar solo on Claramount Lake. Zappa even played the record during a radio interview many years later.\n\n2. Tomorrow was an emo/post-punk band from Tampa, FL, active from 1994 to 1999. \n\nTomorrow released a Self-Titled 7\" (1995, Blacksmith), a split 7\" with Exhaust (1995, Blacksmith), a split 11\" with Hot Water Music (1997, No Idea) and two CD EPs; The Industry Of Natural Occurence (1998, No Idea) and Build a Brand New Sky (1999, Schematics).\n\nThey also appeared on several compilations; Direction CD (1996, Polivinyl), 403 Comp: Florida Fucking Hardcore (1998, Schematics), and Back to Donut! (1999, No Idea).\n\n3. Tomorrow may also refer to a Japanese thrash metal band. Taking queues from the Italian metal scene, the members of Tomorrow embrace not only the Italian's fast, over-driven sound but also the language itself.\n\n4. 90's influenced newschool hardcore from Ukraine in the vein of Mean Season, Ressurection, 108, Skygrain, Inside Out. http://tomorrowxxx.bandcamp.com/track/candles-light\n\n5. Traditional doom metal band from Toledo, Ohio that was active in the late 90s. Recorded the EP \"Divinatory Mourning\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tomorrow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
