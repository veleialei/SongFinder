Chris and Dale being brothers work as a vigorous team, constantly contributing to the music scene. Multi-talented musicians coming from a background in bands, both are highly adaptable to style and play piano, guitar, bass, drums. \n\nTheir first commercial dance release 'Sweetest Dreams' which burst into clubland in 2003, was reviewed by Guy Ornadel as \"A great emotive hands in the air Vangelis trance track with excellent key programming, I've no doubt this will be MASSIVE at Passion, Gatecrasher & Godskitchen - it's a stormer!!\" \n\nHe wasn't wrong, having won the Lynx White Label Euphoria Competition on Tall Paulâ€™s Kiss 100 show, the buzz around the track resulted in huge label interest with Graham Gold beating the pack to snap it up for Relative Records. When released, a remix provided by up and coming producer Greg Murray (Platipus/Lost Language) found a place within many DJ's boxes, it continued to receive massive airplay and jumped on various compilations. On first hearing the track, established Dutch producer Ferry Corsten later remixed the track establishing it as a true anthem with airplay on both Kiss FM and Radio 1's Dance Anthems. The track has received major support from the likes of Paul Van Dyk, Armin Van Buuren, Dave Pearce, Scott Bond, Matt Hardwick, Adam White and many more. \n\nNot being solely limited to the constraints of one style, Corderoy spend time writing and producing in many varying techniques, with other aliasis to their name. Although heavily involved in writing and producing their own material, Corderoy still find time to turn their unique style into remixing other artist tracks. With their pinnacle work being their BBC Radio 1 remix of Marc Et Claude's 'La' released on Positiva Records in 2003. \n\nIn 2004 Corderoy followed up their record breaking first release with a another stormer namely 'Deeper'. Featuring the vocals of the ultra talented Kirstie Gorton the track went on to gain huge support from all the big names, also gaining the honour of it being voted Judge Jules web chart winner by the public, even beating Eric Prydz 'Call on me' to win. Jules went on to champion the track on his show with 8 weeks continuous play on Radio 1. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Corderoy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
