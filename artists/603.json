The track was the No.1 added track to US radio with 35 adds throughout summer 2013. The remix was then added to BBC Radio One’s A-List, reaching No.4 in the Official UK Charts, making it his most successful single to date. The track reached number 6 on the American Billboard chart, UK iTunes Chart to No.2 & US iTunes Chart to No.17. The remix was reviewed in MTV, and the The Daily Star. The track also achieved double platinum status in America. He won a Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non Classical for the song.\n\nMichael Bay's 2013 film Pain & Gain featured two of Gervais' tracks, including his hit 'Molly'.
