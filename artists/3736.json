Unearth masterfully combine an intoxicating mix of American and European metal with hardcore ethic and punch. This unique approach makes Unearth one of the most abrasive, commanding and emotionally charged groups in heavy music today.\nFormed in 1998, Unearth has accomplished more on their own than most bands can do with full support of a label and press. Constant tours all over the globe have earned them respect and recognition from their peers and helped cultivate one of the strongest fan bases around. In the last two years alone, Unearth has embarked on a sold-out headlining tour with Terror, Black Dahlia Murder and Remembering Never in tow, a sold-out run alongside Atreyu, and high profile treks with Slipknot, Killswitch Engage, Sounds Of The Underground 2005, The Headbanger's Ball tour and Ozzfest 2004. This summer, Unearth will head back overseas as a featured act on Sounds Of The Underground Europe and will once again tear up the US on the now infamous Ozzfest before unleashing their brutal new album in August.\n\nThe highly anticipated release \"III: In The Eyes Of Fire\" was produced by the legendary Terry Date (Soundgarden, Pantera, Deftones) and should satisfy even their most hardcore of fans. While most bands these days seem to have replaced breakdowns with \"pretty\" choruses, Unearth have gone in the opposite direction delivering their most brutal album to date. This crushing follow up to 2004's \"The Oncoming Storm\", is sure to cause nothing less than total destruction to every mosh pit in its wake.\n\nOn October 14, 2008, Unearth released their fourth album, entitled The March. The album features a re-recorded version of the song \"The Chosen,\" which they contributed to the album Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters Colon the Soundtrack. The band recently completed a tour with Gwen Stacy, Whitechapel, The Acacia Strain and Protest the Hero. They are currently on the Never Say Die Club Tour with Parkway Drive, Despised Icon, Architects, Protest The Hero, Whitechapel and Carnifex. They will be on the Metal Hammer Defenders of the Faith tour with other acts such as Lamb of God, Dimmu Borgir and Five Finger Death Punch. As of Early 2009, it has been confirmed by billboard.com that The March has sold more than 100,000 copies world wide.\n\nJustin Foley (Killswitch Engage, Blood Has Been Shed) handled the drumming on the band's 2011 album Darkness in the Light. Nick Pierce began touring with the group in 2011 before being announced as their official drummer in early 2012.\n\n\n2) Unearth was a death metal band from Albuquerque, New Mexico. They released 2 demos, Malformed Cranium in 1994 and Spill the Plagues in 1995.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Unearth\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
