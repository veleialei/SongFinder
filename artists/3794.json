With their doomy, progressive and different approach to metal they’ve stood out in the Bergen, Norway music scene since the band formed in 2002. Their sound is a unique mix of extreme, melodic, symphonic, industrial and slightly experimental metal.\n\nAlthough Vulture Industries is quite a young band, they hold signifcant musical experience, and consists of current and former members of Sulphur, Black Hole Generator, Malice In Wonderland, Enslaved (session), Taake (session) and Syrach. Their debut album “The Dystopia Journals” was recorded and mixed between September 2006 and May 2007. The album was produced by vocalist Bjørnar E. Nilsen (also producer of Helheim, Dead To This World, Sulphur, Deathcon etc.) at his Conclave & Earshot Studio, with the assistance of Herbrand Larsen and Arve Isdal (Enslaved). For the record cover, the band got an appearance from the highly regarded Norwegian actor Helge Jordal. So far, the band has received excellent feedback for their two demos and live performances, getting 9/10 in both Terrorizer and Heavymetal. The band has been compared to bands like Arcturus, Solefald, Manes, The Provenance and Red Harvest. \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Vulture+Industries\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
