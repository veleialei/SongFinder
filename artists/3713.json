Thirty-two of her singles have reached the Number 1 position on Christian radio national airplay charts. These include \"He Is Exalted\", \"God Is In Control\", \"We Bow Down\" and \"The Warrior Is A Child\". She has received five GMA Dove Awards, and three American Songwriter Awards.\n\nSome of Paris' songs have been included in the hymnals by a variety of churches including the United Methodist church and various Charismatic churches. In recent years, Paris has focused on recording new versions of some of her worship standards and writing new praise and worship music in contrast to contemporary Christian pop songs that she released the latter 1990s.\n\nHer uncle, Loren Cunningham is the founder of Youth With A Mission, while her family started Ecclesia College in Elm Springs, Arkansas, where her brother Oren Paris III is president and father Oren Paris II is chancellor. Paris herself studied theology and sacred music, though she has claimed to have placed little emphasis in her formal studies on composition or songwriting. Beyond songwriting, she is the author of four books, three of which focus on contemporary Christian theology.\n\nShe and her husband Jack Wright have one child, Jack Paris Wright, born April 29, 2001.\n\nAlthough widely associated for much of her career with Star Song Records, EMI switched her over to the Sparrow label in 1996, before her contract ended after 2003. In 2005, she switched to Michael Coleman's INO label. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Twila+Paris\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
