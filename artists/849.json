Their music is fast and experimental; their drums commonly feature blast beats, and their guitars are a blur of high pitched squeals and fast fretting. With the release of Hell Songs, Daughters became more of a noise rock band - with vocals more reminiscent of The Jesus Lizard's David Yow than a traditional hardcore or metalcore vocalist - and toured with bands such as The Locust, Russian Circles, Young Widows, and The Chinese Stars.\n\nThey have four releases: a self-titled EP (2002), Canada Songs (2003), Hell Songs (2006), and a self-titled album, Daughters (2010). In April 2009 Sargent House re-issued their Self-titled EP from 2002 with new artwork.\n\nIn March, 2010 Daughters released a final self-titled LP on Hydrahead Records, without longtime members Nicholas Sadler and Samuel Walker.\n\nNick Sadler, the ex-guitar player of Daughters, plays in a project named Fang Island, which is a band that breaks away from the musical style in which he played with Daughters. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Daughters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
