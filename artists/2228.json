A Six-time Emmy Award winner, Margaret recently left her gig as a writer and producer for the Ellen Degeneres Show to work on her own projects. She is currently in negotiations on a pilot she has developed.\n \nShe also recently published her first book. A hilarious yet poignant, partial memoir about becoming a single mother. It’s titled, \"What Was I Thinking\".\n\nAdditionally, she has won the American Comedy Award for Best Female Stand Up Comedian. She starred in her own special for Comedy Central and has produced and starred in her own independent projects. Her incredibly funny CD, titled \"As It Should Be\" has a liner note on the cover from Jay Leno. Jay writes, “, “The best comedians are the ones that write and perform their own material and Margaret Smith is at the top of that list”,\n\n\nShe played the standout record store owner in the hilarious, yet short-lived, spin off of “That 70's Show” aptly titled “The 80's Show”.\n\nHer list of roles in Television and Film include parts in Martin Scorsese’s “Goodfellas”, the remake of “The Blob”, the Wachowski brother’s hit thriller “Bound” with Gina Gershon and Meg Tilly, and a guest starring role in the Pamela Anderson series, “VIP”, to name a few.\n\nYou may have also seen one of her many performances on both The Tonight Show with Jay Leno as well as Late Show with David Letterman.\n\nMargaret has toured the comedy circuit doing live performances throughout the United States and beyond including Britain, Ireland and Australia, not to mention a one-nighter in Tasmania. “Have you ever seen a Tasmanian Devil? They’re so cute. You want to pet them, ‘till they yawn.”\n\nShe’s worked with everyone from Rosie O’Donnell to the late Bob Hope. She says, “Phyllis Diller told me the dirtiest joke I’ve ever heard,” and claims to have had an emotional bottom on The Oprah Winfrey Show.\n\nYou might want to keep your eyes open for Margaret during her summer hiatus when she hits the road and tours. She may be coming to a theater in your area. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Margaret+Smith\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
