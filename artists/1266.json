The band was formed in 1996 by Wednesday 13, who recruited friends and former Maniac Spider Trash bandmates Seaweed and Sicko Zero. The band's history is riddled with a 'revolving door' lineup with 13 the only member to have never been replaced.\n\nAfter breaking up in 2001 when Wednesday 13 left to perform vocals with the Murderdolls, the band reformed for a brief reunion between 2004 and 2005 releasing a box set containing their entire recordings except for the track \"Look Mom I Killed A Chicken\" because Wednesday 13's master copy was \"destroyed beyond repair\" this track exclusively available on the 197666 7 inch LP and the band-released \"Chop of My Hand\" CD-R.\n\nThe music of the Frankenstein Drag Queens was played in a punk rock style. Lyrically the band were inspired by horror B-movies and references in popular culture. As well as a large leaning towards punk the band's live show and appearance took cues from glam rock acts such as Alice Cooper, New York Dolls and KISS. They were known to wear dresses and make-up on stage as part of their performance. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Frankenstein+Drag+Queens+from+Planet+13\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
