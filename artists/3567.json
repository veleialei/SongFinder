Meat Is Murder went on to enter the British charts at number one in February of 1985, and The Queen Is Dead further confirmed the band's popularity with its release in spring 1986. Greeted with enthusiastic reviews and peaking at number two on the U.K. charts, the album also developed The Smiths' cult following in the U.S., breaking into the Top 100.\n\nAfter the band's split in 1987, a further six albums have been released, bringing the total number of Smiths albums to 13. These albums consisted of another five compilation albums (Best... I, ...Best II, Singles, The Very Best of the Smiths and The Sound of the Smiths), and one live album (Rank) recorded before the band's split during The Queen Is Dead tour. Both \"Best I\" and \"Best II\" were heavily criticised by critics and some fans; \"The Very Best of\", was very similar content to said \"Best\" albums, sold excellently, but drew much criticism from press and the band, who had no input.\n\nFormer members\n\nBass was originally played by Dale Hibbert, but he was replaced after 4 months. Craig Gannon was briefly a second guitarist for the band in 1986.\nSee The Smiths First Meetings  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
