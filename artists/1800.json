All these experiences made him the mature artist of today.\n \nWe can say he’s “Natural born artist”. His innate talent, his creativity and strong will made him especially known for his mood and for his inspiration. But Joy is always the reserved and quiet person he was before and he doesn’t like talking too much about himself or boasting about his success, because he gives in charge to the music the power to tell his story. The dj is a chef, that can mix sounds, riffs, cool bass effects, drums, percussions … at the desks he “cooks” and everytime he produces a different and original set: you can give the same records to another dj and the result will always be different.\n\n“When the dj plays his music, he feels like a writer: and when he plays he always shows something about his soul, his mind and his heart. Sounds are like words and you can combine them in thousands of different ways and sometimes you can’t control them. Playing for me is a necessity. Even if Electronic Music needn’t classical instruments and scores, it offers the same possibilities of other genres.”\n \nMixer of sounds Joy has already released many tracks on BXR Label (MediaRecords), signed with his real name or with different pseudonymes (Jakyro, Joman). He’s also known and appreciated for the chill out and vip lounge atmospheres he can suggest in his compilations.\nBut Joy Kitikonti’roots are in the Underground Clubs scene, where he’s really loved for his creative fantasy and his original sound, but especially for his unbelievable technical ability at the mixer.\n\nHe’s a member of Metempsicosi (www.metempsicosi.com), the free association among six artists who share ideas, sound and successes, not the typical djs or events agency, that only thinks about the djs booking date and promotion, but a project itself. His own life is a mix: a combination of sounds, moods, styles, places, images. The “contamination” is the key to re-invent and to live your life with your personal style, to escape the banality and the danger of something already seen and already heard. His “hand” is always perceivable in his productions.\n \nJoy is a creative mind and his last web project www.artofjoy.org is a real factory, a trip into his mind through the human senses. “Joyenergizer”, “Joydontstop”, “Pornojoy”, “Dirtysummer” made him famous in all the world and he quickly joined the most famous gigs, clubs and events in all the countries, and this success gave him the possibility to meet foreign big artists.\n\nHis underground vocation comes from those boundary territories, where music means fun, not just money, where friendship among the artists goes further than the interests of the music industry, where you can find in your hands some white labels, dreamt by the records shops, and where new ideas and moods are generated by the artists’ exchange and partnerships. Joy belongs to that world where, if we can use the espression… vanguards often born.\n\nHe’s A&R for Metempsicosi rec, Client rec with dj Moss (Colombia) and Stephan Krus, Movement rec with Tom Pooks (France) and he joined the Marco Carola’s labels (Elp Medien group)\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Joy+Kitikonti\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
