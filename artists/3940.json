Although not a massive commercial success, the fresh ideas of the younger members mixed with the traditions of the other members pointed a way forward in music.\n\nThe follow up named \"Pump Up The Bhangra\" was a best selling album that brought western beats & traditional influences to new heights, pleasing south asian youth and establishing Pardesi as one of the most sought-after and popular bands in the genre.\n\n1990 saw the release of their fourth album titled \"Shake Yer Pants\" featuring some of the most popular bhangra songs of all time.\n\nhttp://www.pardesi.co.uk/\n\nMusic from their albums has received air play on a number of U.K Radio and Television broadcasts including: 'The Clothes Show', 'MotorMouth', 'Def II' and even used as the title music to BBC's 'Ipso Facto'. The band has recorded live sessions for BBC's \"Network East\" and \"What's that Noise\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pardesi\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
