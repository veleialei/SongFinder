from Connecticut, USA;\n3) women vocal group from Ingushetia, Russia.\n\n1)\nThings have not let up in 2007 for The Aftermath after the success of 2 top 20 singles in the second part of 2006(One is Fun reaching no11 and Hollywood Remake hitting no 19 beating Madonna and My Chemical Romance to highest new entry’s). \n\nBoth singles featured in Phantom Fm, Irelands leading alternative Radio stations best 105 songs of 2006. They were also voted no 9 in the most promising for 2007 Hot Press Readers Poll as well as getting a mention from Kaiser Chiefs at this years Meteor awards when asked which Irish band’s they rated at the moment. \n\nWith over 40 dates completed in the UK and Ireland this year which include sold out shows in Dublin, Galway, Mullingar, Liverpool, Leeds & Harrogate the non-stop tour since last July continues with dates building up to the release of new single “All I want is for you to be happy” recorded by Karl Odlum (Fionn Regan, David Kitt, mixed by Ger McDonald of Travis and U2 fame and mastered by the legendary Greg Calbi in Sterling Sound, released on their own Live Transmission Records on July 20th. Many bands looked on last year asking how an independent band could get 2 top 20’s on their own steam. The simple truth is hard work. The Aftermath spent those chart weeks touring Ireland, playing small venues, independent record stores, lunchtime gigs, doing what they do best – entertaining regular people, who repaid the favour by buying their record. It’s pretty simple, and more importantly, not the done thing in this age of digital distro-whackery and bands who think that five gigs later they should be selling out The Point. \n\nMedia picked up on The Aftermath without the prodding of publicists and promoter offerings started coming in. Soon, Johnny, Michael, Justin and Martin found themselves opening for Razorlight, The Streets and The Mission on Irish and European dates. Gathering together the required cash, the band headed off to France to record their album with Karl and Dave Odlum. This is the point where the years of hard work in the UK came to fruition. ‘Friends’ hopped on planes and trains and headed out to meet the band – Phil Vinyl, the man behind Placebo, Elastica and Pulp, offered producer strokes. Terry Edwards, whose work with Tindersticks is well documented, played his part. The Waterboy’s Steve Wickham joined the fray, as did Damien Rice cellist Vyvienne Long, Una O’Kane (renowned for her work with U2 and BellX1) and Duncan Patterson (Anathema/Antimatter) threw in some bass lines. Paul Weller keyboardist Helen Turner continues to play live with the band. Words of wisdom came from legendary producer Mike Hedges and close friends Irish Jack Lyons, an old associate of The Who’s. The, debut album is all but ready and scheduled for release in early 2008. In the meantime, The Aftermath re-plough the highways and byways of Ireland, the UK and Europe. \n\nWith endorsements from the likes of Jackie Hayden from Hot Press who said ”touches of Talking Heads and Roxy Music with spacey drum sounds, strident string’s, fuzzed up guitars and impassioned vocal’s. When a band avoid the obvious they can be truly inventive and stimulating.” Totally Dublin said, “…think Arcade Fire carousing with Franz Ferdinand and you’re nearly there.” The Leeds Guide ‘ they sound like Roxy Music having a fight with the Pixies down a Northern backstreet.” and The Sunday Tribune called them “the perfect pop machine”. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Aftermath\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
