In 2009 he released \"Solid Ground\" his twelth solo album, and he has also recently re-issued six of his previous albums on BGO Records.\n\nRecent live dates have included a return to Scandinavia for the Norretljes Blues and Rock Festival near Stockholm, Sweden, and London shows with SALT, Mick's 70s blues rock band formed with Stevie Smith - the first new SALT gigs for 33 years.\n\nMick began his solo career in the early 80s and has become an established name on the European scene, touring regularly in every country from Finland down to Italy. Praised for his fiery \"straight from the wood\" guitar sound, he has appeared on numerous festivals with artists such as Robert Cray, Johnny Winter and the late Rory Gallagher.\n\nRecent tours have included appearances at the Baden Blues Festival in Switzerland, \"Rock at Sea\" in Stockholm, Sweden, Harelbeke Rock and Blues in Belgium and the Bragdoya Blues Festival in Norway.

In 2003 the original band got together again to record a brand new CD, and in January 2004 Killing Floor released \"Zero Tolerance\" - its first new album for 32 years. The band has now begun to play selected festival appearances around Europe, and a fourth album is currently in production.\n\nIn the mid 70s Mick co-formed SALT a powerful blues-rock act who were a big hit on the London scene in the 70s playing regularly at the Marquee and other top venues. The band played at the Reading Festival and also opened for Muddy Waters at two major London concerts. SALT has also reformed for occasional re-union tours.\n\nMicks first solo album Looking For Trouble came out on the Italian label Appaloosa in the early 80s and sold well. More albums quickly followed including West Coast Connection recorded in Portland, Oregon with local musicians.
