Okmulgee, Oklahoma, September 30, 1922; d.

He and  Dizzy Gillespie  led a bop group in 1944. in 1945 Pettiford went with Hawkins to California, where he appeared in The Crimson Canary, a mystery movie known for its jazz soundtrack. He then worked with  Duke Ellington from 1945 to 1948 and for Woody Herman in 1949 before working mainly as a leader in the 1950s.\n\nAs a leader he inadvertently discovered  Cannonball Adderley . After one of his musicians had tricked him into letting Adderley, an unknown music teacher, onto the stand, he had Adderley solo on a demanding piece, on which Adderley performed impressively.\n\nPettiford is considered the pioneer of the cello as a solo instrument in jazz music. In 1949, after suffering a broken arm, Pettiford found it impossible to play his bass, so he experimented with a cello a friend had lent him. Tuning it in fourths, like a double bass, but one octave higher, Pettiford found it possible to perform during his rehabilitation (during which time his arm was in a sling) and made his first recordings with the instrument in 1950. The cello thus became his secondary instrument, and he continued to perform and record with it throughout his career.\n\nSee also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Pettiford <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Oscar+Pettiford\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
