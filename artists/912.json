Glasgow started singing from age 12, at which point she was working with popular producer Mad Professor. Adopting the alias Debbie G., she gained popularity on the London reggae scene despite parting with Mad Professor's label.\n\nHer meeting with another London producer, Patrick Donegan, led to a new recording contract with UK Bubblers and several hit singles. In 1989 she released her only full length album, an eponymous debut. Her biggest hit came from Shabba Rank's reworking of her song \"Champion Lover\" from that album, called \"Mr. Lover Man\".\n\nHowever, Glasgow chose her family instead of musical fame, with the exception of a brief recording stint. Unfortunately, she was diagnosed with lymphoma in the early 90s and died on January 25, 1994 from a brain hemorrhage. A collection release, \"The Legend\", has since been put out. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Deborahe+Glasgow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
