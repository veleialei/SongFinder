The band built a following with their energetic performances at local venues, and released the self-financed extended play, Church of Realities. Legal issues forced Hed to change their name, adding PE, which stood for Planet Earth.\n\nBand members;\nJared Gomes — vocals (1994-current)\nMawk (Mark Young) — bass (1994-current)\nDJ Product © 1969 (Doug Boyce) — turntables (1994-current)\nJaxon — guitar (2004-current)\nTrauma — drums (2009-current) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/(hed)+Planet+Earth\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
