Caspian is an American instrumental rock band from Beverly, Massachusetts. The band formed in Autumn of 2003 and played their first concert in August of 2004.\n\nEarly history: 2003-2004\nCaspian loosely formed in Autumn of 2003 in Beverly, Massachusetts, developing material through the first year of its existence, recording a demo in May 2004 and performing a small number of shows in late 2004 and early 2005, including a support for the Japanese post-rock band Mono. The band's first performance took place at The Pickled Onion in Beverly, Massachusetts on August 26, 2004. At the time the band had not yet chosen the name Caspian and were looking for a vocalist.\n\nYou Are The Conductor: 2005-2006\nIn January 2005, the band signed with Dopamine Records, releasing a debut EP, You Are the Conductor in November 2005. This was followed, in January 2006, with the band's first tour of the Northeast comprising 4 dates in New York, DC and Pittsburgh. In April and May 2006, the band embarked on its first full tour of the USA, reaching to the west coast and back. A hand pressed, limited edition (100 total) tour EP was released by the band in September 2006 on their 2nd full tour of the USA.\n\nThe Four Trees: 2007-2008\nOver the course of 2006, the band developed material for a debut album, recording with Ethan Dussault again in August 2006 in Cambridge, MA at the newly renovated New Alliance Audio. Released on Dopamine Records on April 10, 2007., their debut album \"The Four Trees\" continued their positive exposure to a growing underground of Post-Rock fans, and was named the No. 1 album of 2007 by The Silent Ballet. The album was re-released in Europe by Make My Day Records in July 2008. Later that year, they recorded a Split 7\" with fellow Massachusetts band Constants.\n\nOnce again Caspian embarked on three long coast to coast tour of the United States to support the release. After learning that founding member, guitarist Calvin Joss, could no longer fulfill touring duties, Erin Burke-Moran of The Fly-Agaris Sky, was initially recruited to tour in place of Joss, but became a full time member immediately following their 2007 Spring US Tour.\n\nTertia: 2009-2011\nNow officially a 5 piece band, Caspian released a follow-up to their debut called Tertia in Europe on 7 August 2009 and in the US on 15 September 2009. Caspian once again recorded the album in February 2007 at New Alliance Audio with Ethan Dussault.\n\nTo tour the album upon its release, Caspian enlisted Washington DC area guitarist, Jonny Ashburn, and Austin, TX bassist, Jon McMahan to assist. \"Tertia\" was supported by two massive European tours (Fall of 2009 and Spring 2010) and a two month North American tour (March/April 2010) that included a supporting slot for Los Angeles based Post-Rock outfit, Red Sparowes and Brooklyn indie rockers, Fang Island. In July 2010 the band played their first ever shows in China. The 2 date \"Asian Tour\" was July 16 at the Hidden Agenda Live House and the second was on the 17th of July in Guangzhou, as part of the Qiangyuan Music Festival. The band toured the US in September and then Europe in November and December playing support with God is an Astronaut.In 2010 alone the band performed close to 150 concerts in 33 countries on 3 continents. The band played their final concert of 2010 at the Middle East Downstairs in Cambridge MA as part of the \"Last Night on Earth\", the 8th of the series, with Constants, Irepress and Moving Mountains. Portland Maine based artist Kris Johnsen created a limited number of posters for the show.\n\nWaking Season: 2011-present\nIn a band blog update in early January 2011 the band said that most of their time over the next year would be spent writing and recording their 3rd full-length album. They performed at the 2011 SXSW Music Festival in Austin, TX and played an 8 day European tour in April 2011 visiting Russia, Germany, Poland, and the Netherlands including a headline performance at the Dunk! Festival in Zottegem, Belgium. The band has stated that they plan to take a year long break from touring to focus exclusively on new material, starting May 2011.\n\nAfter much time away from the stage, November 11 and 12 had the band playing their first hometown shows since early in the year. On November 11 they played in Northampton, MA and then the 12th at Great Scott in Allston, MA. The band dove deep in to the archive, playing \"Loft\" for the first time in Boston in over 4 years. The set also included 3 new songs, none which have titles. The music remains heavy, but the band appears to be reaching out more.\n\nAround this same time the bands label mylene sheath announced plans for the first ever Caspian live album release. Songs taken from the October 2010 Old South Church show will be pulled together for a limited vinyl release of 1000 copies (in various colors). Within two days, two of the versions were sold out. The album is also now available via digital download.\n\nOn July 9, 2012 the band announced by their site/Facebook/Twitter the album title would be \"Waking Season\". A teaser was also released on YouTube. At the end of the clip the release date only reads \"Autumn 2012\". The release date was later confirmed to be September 21, 2012. Deluxe versions of the album came with a small music box and a note asking fans to \"create the basis of a song\". The band promises to listen to all submissions and a lucky fan will have their submission be considered for a future track. A week before the album's US release Spin.com posted a full stream of the album and called it \"The Post Rock Album of the Year\".\n\nThe band played a few shows before starting a 16 show run in support of Minus the Bear and Cursive. Upon completion of that string of dates the band headed to Europe touring from October 10th, through November 20th.\n\nIn February of 2013 the band set off on another massive North American tour in support of the newly released \"Waking Season\" with supporting acts, Native and Junius on a number of dates.\n\n\n\nCaspian consists of 5 members:\n* Philip Jamieson (guitar, programming, loops)\n* Calvin Joss (guitar, glockenspiel, loops)\n* Erin Burke-Moran (guitar)\n* Chris Friedrich (deceased) (bass guitar)\n* Joe Vickers (drums)\n\n(Burke-Moran was added to the group after the writing/recording of \"The Four Trees\" was completed.)\n\n2.
