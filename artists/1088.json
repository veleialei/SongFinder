They followed this with a full-length album titled \"Yesterday Is Time Killed\" on Cedargate Records. Upon switching to Trustkill Records, they recorded their 2000 album Until The Ink Runs Out. For their next album, \"Best Of\", the band re-recorded much of their earlier, out of print, material. The music style of the band changed a lot since their 2002 debut \"Vanity\", which birthed a music video single for \"You Broke Like Glass\" which played in heavy rotation via MTV2's Headbangers Ball. Eighteen Visions then released \"Obsession\" in 2004 which would be their last album for Trustkill Records.\n\nOn July 18 2006 they released a self-titled album through Epic Records. Their single \"Victim\" climbed the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, and was the official theme song of WWE Vengeance that year.\n\nEighteen Visions broke up in April 2007.\n\nOn February 9, 2017, an official Instagram account of the band was launched, with James Hart, Keith Barney, and Trevor Friedrich being tagged on the first picture which contained the message, \"the countdown begins...\" All three members uploaded the same picture onto their respective private accounts as well. They continued to share studio footage and a teaser of a new song. Mick Kenney (Anaal Nathrakh) was revealed to be producing, mixing, and mastering the band's comeback record at his Huntington Beach, CA studio The Barracks.\n\nOn April 20, 2017, ten years from the day of their farewell show at Chain Reaction in Anaheim, the band confirmed details surrounding their comeback album XVIII, which would be released on June 2 via Rise Records. They also released a full stream and music video for \"Oath.\" They released a second single, \"Crucified,\" on May 9 with a lyric video. Both songs are under 2 minutes in length and marked the return of heavy screaming as a prominent element of the band's sound. The band also confirmed that one of the album's tracks, \"Live Again,\" is a tribute to the late former bassist Mick Morris. The third single released was \"The Disease, the Decline, and Wasted Time\" on May 25.\n\nIn June 2017, it was revealed that Ken Floyd couldn't take part in the reunion due to his full-time job as a tour manager for Zedd. It was also reported that the band decided not to replace Mick Morris with another bassist out of respect for him. Instead, his bass tracks will be used at live shows for the songs released prior to 2017. Keith Barney, however, ruled out the possibility of any extensive touring in the near future due to full-time jobs that band members have.\n\nXVIII was released as planned on June 2, 2017, coinciding with the release of a music video for \"Live Again\" and a show at The Observatory in Santa Ana with Retox and Seizures. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eighteen+Visions\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
