After her inclusion on A Woman's Heart, a compilation album and a tribute to her work on The Late Late Show, Shannon's music received a great deal of exposure, contributing to the record-breaking sales of her debut album\n\nHer 2000 album, The Diamond Mountain Sessions, which included vocals from a wide variety of artists, was also a commercial success, being certified triple platinum.\n\nShannon recorded with Steve Earle on the song \"The Galway Girl\", which was released on both Earle's album Transcendental Blues, and Shannon & Friends' The Diamond Mountain Sessions. Both albums were released in 2000.\n\nAnother collaboration with Earle was the instrumental \"Dominic Street\", released on Earle's 2002 album Sidetracks.
