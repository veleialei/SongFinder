He is a skilled accordionist, guitarist, pianist, performer.\n\nHe entered the world music scene early, in 1998, as member of X Darawish, a multinational band based in Italy.\n\nIn 2003 he recorded his first solo album ‘Radiopirate’, rooted in his experience of living and musically acting both in Italy and Greece.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2006 has joined numerous gigs and festivals all over Greece and Europe. He has collaborated with Dionisis Savopoulos, Evanthia Reboutsika, Panayotis Kalantzopoulos & Eli Paspala.\n\nIn July of 2007 Kostis has recorded his second album forming his new multiethnic band. In ‘ilegal’, Balkan electric guitars, Latin trumpets, Jewish saxophones, classical cello are perfectly fused together under ska, reggae, rock, punk, r&b rhythms, all influenced by traditional Greek, and gypsy melodies plenty of free improvisation parts. This project introduces for the very first time in Greek discography a totally new sound never heard before.\n\nIn 'Ilegal', Maraveyas communicates his view for love, dreaming, travelling and comments on the vanity of moneymaking, racism, and imperialism. Musically wise, he merges Greek music forms with Italian, Spanish and the so-called Mediterranean temperament. The record primarily sounds like a radio program with a soundtrack: a journey into life. The ingredients are festiveness, happiness, love, passion, and agony for peace.\n\nThe LP has gained early great power play by top Greek radios as KOSMOS 936 world music, ERA, MELODIA, DIESI and other. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kostis+Maraveyas\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
