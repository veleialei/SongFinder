This is a series of comic sketches, impersonations and parodies that have featured Rosenstock being Bertie Ahern, Colin Farrell and Roy Keane amongst many others.\n\nHe performed an impersonation of José Mourinho in a parody of a song from the musical Joseph. This spread like wildfire on Internet message boards and eventually it was played on a Sky Sports broadcast. Mourinho heard the song and liked the impersonation so much he had Mario perform a private show for him and the Chelsea squad. Mario later released, with Mourinho's blessing, a single version of José and his Amazing Technicolor Overcoat. He has also released another song on the internet with a parody of Mourinho in an interview then breaking into song.\nIn 2005, he achieved the Christmas number one single in the Irish music Charts, with a pardoy of Will Young's song 'Leave Right Now'. The parody concerned Roy Keane's controversial departure from Manchester United Football Club and his fallout with Alex Ferguson. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mario+Rosenstock\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
