Although some people considered the band punk rock, the band itself liked to describe themselves as \"Blister Pop.\"\n\nThe band stopped performing when two of the members moved to Boston. Giessmann drummed for The Del Fuegos, and Goffrier formed the band Big Dipper with former members of the Volcano Suns. Several of The Embarrassment's unreleased songs were recorded by Big Dipper, including \"Faith Healer,\" which was later covered by Japanese all-girl group Shonen Knife.\n\nThe \"Embos,\" as fans call them, have played several reunion concerts in the years since their breakup. They played shows in Lawrence, Kansas and Wichita, Kansas in August 2006. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Embarrassment\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
