She has released 9 studio albums, 2 compilations, 1 live album and 1 EP with Sony Music to date.\n\nBefore going solo Candy Lo was the lead vocalist in Hong Kong based rock band Black & Blue. Before the band released any material, they used to perform independently of Black & Blue as a band as well.\n\nIn 1995 Black & Blue released their first record titled \"Hope In Just One Day\". A year later, in 1996 they released their second album eponymously titled \"Black & Blue\". The former contains songs mostly sung in English while the latter is completely in Cantonese. Stepping away from English and singing completely in Cantonese had been a decision made in concordance with their record label so as to make themselves more understandable to fans. Lo wrote the lyrics to their songs herself.\n\nIn 1998 Candy Lo was signed to Sony Music, thus starting her solo career. Her first release under Sony was an EP called \"Unnecessary To Want..Perfect Can Be Terrible\" (不需要..完美得可怕). For this record she won a Golden Award[1] in the same year. The style of this release continued on from her rock past with Black & Blue. In winter 1998, Candy released a second record called Miao, the title of which refers to Candy's love of cats and how \"they listen while people sometimes don't.\"[2] The album didn't sell as much copies as expected. Producer Kubert Leung blamed the public, who \"failed to grasp the concept of the album\".[3]\n\nLo's 3rd album, Get Close To Candy Lo (貼近盧巧音), released in 1999, set itself apart from the mainstream music that year by adding a philharmonic orchestra to her mix of rock and pop.[4]\n\nIn 2000 Candy Lo again released 2 records, Colour Release (色放) and Muse.\n\nIn July 2001 Candy Lo released Fantasy. Fantasy contained the radio hit \"The Sword And Spear Don't Enter\" (刀枪不入) as well as \"Call\" (呐喊), the theme song for the movie Final Fantasy. Lo's 1st compilation album titled \"Like To Love\" (喜歡戀愛) was also released in that year.\n\nThe release of her 2002 album \"Appreciate The Taste Of Life\" (賞味人間) marked Candy's career with her first smash hit \"Better To be Apart\" (好心分手) for which she collaborated with fellow singer Lee Hom Wang.\n\nOn April 26, 2003 Candy's Airline (糖果航空) was released. In that same year Candy released a concept album titled \"Flower Talk\" (花言.巧語), which combined mellow as well as more upbeat tunes with a classical hint to them.\n\nThree months later Candy Lo released True Music 1st Flight Live 2003, a collection of live renditions of songs released between 1998 and 2003 plus a few covers such as Wong Jim's \"Forget Him\" (忘記他), made famous by Teresa Teng. All of these were performed during a concert in Hong Kong.\n\n\"Evolution Theory\" (天演論) released in 2005, was the last album she recorded before parting company with Sony.[5] It is less mainstream than her previous two albums.[6] However, like Flower Talk, this album deals with spiritual issues such as the uncertainty of the future in \"Junk Girl Of Dystopia\" (敵托邦的拾荒姑娘) and departure in \"Sutra For Seeing Souls Off\" (送魂經).\n\nOn June 11 2007, Candy Lo released her 10th album \"Process\" after joining her new record company \"WOW Music\". Candy Lo is the first artist to release an USB flash memory digital album in Asia. Process contained radio hit \"Can't Even Love\"(愛到不能). Her Mandarin song \"Run Slowly\" (走慢點) is also available at Candy's website at http://candylo.hk which has a hit rate of more than 200,000 times. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/%E7%9B%A7%E5%B7%A7%E9%9F%B3\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
