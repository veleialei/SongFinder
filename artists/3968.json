Unlike most pop idols who perform in front of screaming fans, Shunza's concerts are more intimate and cocktail-style. Over the course of her career, she has collaborated with other Taiwanese artists such as Elva Hsiao and Wilber Pan.\n\nNi Shun Zi was born on February 12, 1973 as the youngest of two children. Her father was a clarinet player, while her mother was a well-known pianist. At the age of 3, she, her mother, and her older sister moved from Beijing to San Francisco as a result of divorce. Upon graduating high school, Shunza studied at the School of Contemporary Jazz in Switzerland. It was there that she founded a band called Duty Free, releasing a few works in Europe. In 1994, Moyan Records, a subsidiary of Rock Records, received one of her demo tapes, and consequently signed her to a record contract.\n\nSince her debut, Shunza has released numerous albums in Mandarin, Japanese, English, and French. In 1999, she was hailed as the Best Female Singer and Best Composer at the 10th Golden Melody Awards. In October 2000, Shunza signed on with EMI, joining Cantopop sensation Faye Wong. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/%E9%A0%86%E5%AD%90\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
