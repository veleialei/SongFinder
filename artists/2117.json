Their sisters, Toni and Encarna, sang backup and would later go on to success on their own as Azucar Moreno.\n\nThe name \"Los Chunguitos\" comes from the pastime of throwing small stones at trains. They began as street buskers, playing in Madrid. In 1977, they auditioned at the offices of record label EMI, and producer Raul Ros convinced the label to sign them.[1] They became hitmakers both in their own country and across Europe with songs such as \"Dame veneno\". They also appeared in the soundtracks to films such as Deprisa, Deprisa, Perros callejeros, and Dias contados.\n\nThe group plays rumba influenced by flamenco and gypsy music. Their lyrics often touch on poverty and misfortune.\n\nThe group is still performing, although Manuel has left the group; the remaining brothers perform as Brothers Salazar.\n\nGMA gitanomusicart\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Los+Chunguitos\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
