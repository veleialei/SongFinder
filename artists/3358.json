Both brothers are singers, with Earl on guitar and Ernie on piano. They became prolific recording artists during the mid to late 1970s, and again since the mid 1990s.\n\nIn their 1950s Fayetteville hometown, where rock pioneer Ronnie Hawkins had also grown up during the 1940s, Hawkins owned and operated the Rockwood Club. There, some of Rock music's earliest pioneers came to play, including Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison and Conway Twitty.\nDuring the late 1950s the Cates associated with Hawkins and his original band members in Arkansas, known as the Hawks, including Hawks drummer Levon Helm. After 1958 Helm and Hawkins left, and settled in Canada, where they went on to form the core of the group The Band.\n\nIn 1975 Levon Helm introduced the Cates to a record company representative in Los Angeles. The Cates soon after received a recording contract with Asylum Records, and so began their recording career. [1]\nTheir 1975 debut self-titled album was produced by guitarist Steve Cropper, who also appeared on the record along with Levon Helm, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn and Poco bass guitarist Timothy B. Schmit, who later joined the Eagles.\nTwo more albums followed in 1976 and 1977.\nIn 1979 they reached a wide audience when they appeared on the PBS music television program Austin City Limits, taped in December of the prior year.\n\nIn 1979 the brothers released their fourth and final album of the period, Fire on the Tracks, which reached number 24 on the album rock charts that year from the success of the single \"Union Man.\" That single was one of the songs the brothers had performed during the Austin City Limits television show, leading up to the album's release.\n\nDuring the 1980s the band's recording career went on hiatus, though they remained a popular touring act around the southern country rock and blues circuit of the Tennessee and Arkansas region.\nIn the early 1980s, the brothers joined Helm, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, and Garth Hudson in a revival of The Band (without guitarist Robbie Robertson), and also worked with blues singer Maria Muldaur.\nThe Cate Brothers resumed recording in the mid 1990s, on a series of independent label albums.\nTheir 1995 release, Radioland, featured blues guitarist Coco Montoya, formerly with the 1980s reformed version of John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers.\n\nIn September 2000, Porky Hill died. He was the drummer for the Cates for 12 years. Ron Eoff's brother Mickey then joined the band. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Cate+Brothers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
