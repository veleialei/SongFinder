Since the start of their career they have been avid pioneers of diverse electronic music, smashing into the early breaks scene and since then, keeping the electro, house and bass music fields supplied with their ever-evolving beats.\n\nThey truly cemented their status as industry heavyweights through the success of still legendary releases such as ‘A Plump Night Out’ and ‘Eargasm’, which in turn led to the run of their epic Eargasm and Headthrash parties at London clubbing institution, Fabric. \n\nAs artists they have developed their unique sound through the recently formed Grand Hotel Records imprint. A platform through which to not only release their own productions, Grand Hotel will showcase work from their endless list of collaborators and protégés, at all times supplying only the highest calibre output to their music hungry fanbase. \n\nIn between the release of recent Grand Hotel tracks, including Boomer and Light Fantastic, Plump DJs have found time to remix the likes of huge international heavyweights Deadmau5, Loops of Fury and Stanton Warriors. This dedicated studio time has resulted in their tracks played out by none other than Carl Cox, Moby, Crookers, Zinc, Kissy Sell Out, Zane Lowe and more, with stellar feedback flowing in from all directions.\n\nHaving already ticked off sell-out shows across the UK, Europe, Asia and Australia in recent months, the Plump DJs 2011 gig schedule is filling up at pace. The summer will see them playing at the UK’s biggest festivals, including Glastonbury, Secret Garden Party and Beatherder, with further international dates spanning the year.\n\nAfter the astounding success of their Grand Hotel Records launch party at London’s XOYO in February, events have since taken place at cool Dalston venue The Nest with round three at XOYO currently in planning, maintaining little doubt the Grand Hotel Records parties are going to become an unmissable event series for dedicated electronic music followers.\n\n\nFor all management and bookings enquiries please contact roman@codaagency.com\n\nFor all Grand Hotel Records enquiries please contact grandhotelconcierge@yahoo.co.uk\n\nFor Finger Lickin Management enquiries and back catalogue please contact abel@fingerlickin.co.uk\n\nFor all publishing enquiries please contact publishing@reverbxl.com \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Plump+DJs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
