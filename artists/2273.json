She sang in her family's group in her youth.\n\nIn 1975 Black joined a small folk band called General Humbert, with whom she toured Europe and released two albums, in 1975 and 1978.

After 1986 she had a successful solo career where she went on to try contemporary styles ranging from jazz to country. She was named \"Best Female Artist\" in the IRMA poll in 1987, 1988, 1992, 1994 and 1996.\n\nShe is married to Joe O'Reilly of Dara Records and they have three children. Her son Danny is a member of the Irish rock band The Coronas, while her daughter Róisín is performing under the name Róisín O.\n\nFor a number of years, \"What Hi-Fi?\" magazine considered Black's voice to be so pure that it was used as an audiophile benchmark for comparing the sound quality of different high fidelity systems.\n\nDiscography\n\n    * 1983 Mary Black\n    * 1984 Collected\n    * 1985 Without the Fanfare\n    * 1987 By the Time it Gets Dark\n    * 1989 No Frontiers\n    * 1991 Babes in the Wood\n    * 1992 The Collection\n    * 1993 The Holy Ground\n    * 1995 Circus\n    * 1997 Shine\n    * 1999 Speaking with the Angel\n    * 2001 The Best of Mary Black 1991-2001 & Hidden Harvest\n    * 2003 Mary Black Live\n    * 2005 Full Tide\n    * 2008 Twenty-Five Years Twenty-Five Songs\n    * 2011 Stories from the Steeples\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mary+Black\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
