Rock band from Quilmes, Argentina.\n2. Christian progressive metal band from Guatemala, Guatemala.\n3. An experimental coldwave band from France\n\n1. Vox Dei (Latin: God's Voice) is an Argentine rock band. Its most prolific years were the 1970s, having recorded 10 albums.\nThe band's original members were Juan Carlos \"Yody\" Godoy (guitar and vocals), Ricardo Soulé (guitar and vocals), Rubén Basoalto (drums) and Willy Quiroga (bass and vocals).\nIn 1968 they recorded a version of Percy Sledge's \"When a Man Loves a Woman\", and the company Mandioca organized an audition for them in the Payró theatre. The members of Manal and Almendra were also present, and a few hours later they played together. In 1970 they recorded for Mandioca their first album Caliente.\nIn the B.A. Rock Festival Vox Dei played the first part of the theme \"Genesis\", which had no lyrics yet. In February 1971 they released La Biblia ('The Bible'). Being the first Argentine concept album, it became a turning point in the history of Argentine rock; even the Archdiocese, that had asked to examine the lyrics, recommended young people to buy it. Right after the recording of La Biblia, Jorge Godoy left the band and was replaced by Ignacio Smilari.\nIn 1972 they re-edited their first album and recorded the third one, Jeremías Pies de Plomo. During the first shows after the release, they recorded La Nave Infernal and a few months later Es una Nube, No Hay Duda. After Vox Dei para Vox Dei of 1974, Ricardo Soulé announced he would leave the band to start as a soloist. Carlos Michelini replaced him while recording Estamos en la Pecera in 1975, and then was himself replaced by Raúl Fernandez. In 1976 they recorded Ciegos de Siglos.\nSoulé returned to the band in 1978 to record Gata de Noche. Slowly the differences between the musicians started to grow, but they respected the contract that kept them together until 1981. In 1986 Vox Dei regrouped to present and record live \"La Biblia\" in the Teatro Ópera. In 1988 they made a \"come back\", to produce Tengo Razones para Seguir with Luis Valenti. Towards the end of 1989, Ricardo Soulé the band left again. In 1992 Carlos Gardellini becomes his new guitar. With guitar Gardellini have recorded the albums: Sin Darle Ya Más Vueltas in 1994, and El Camino in 2005. They have recorded with Ricardo Soulé a remake of La Biblia in 1997 entitled La Biblia II. On November 3, 2010, drummer Rubén Basoalto dies of lung cancer. After that, the band has a not well defined future.\n\n2. Vox Dei is a Christian Progressive Heavy Metal band from Guatemala.  Vox Dei was formed in 1989 in Guatemala City, the name means God's Voice.  It is usually confused with the secular band from Argenitna Vox Dei.  For many, Vox Dei are the fathers of the Guatemalan White Metal.\nMembers:\nEstuardo Meza - Voice\nPablo Izquierdo - Drums\nWilly Estrada - Guitar\nSaúl Aragón - Lead Guitar\nFormer Members:\nHedras Ramos Sr. - Lead Guitar (From 1989 until 1995)\nRony Madrid - Keyboard (From 1989 until 1991)\nRussell Madrid - Guitar (From 1989 until 1991)\nHugo Meza - Drums\nJohn Seamans - Bass\nDavid Arredondo - Bass\nDiscography:\nQuítate la Máscara - 1990\nTorre Fuerte - 1993\nCiudad Distante - 1995\nRompiendo el Molde - 1996\nCuenta Regresiva - 1999\nNada que Ver - 2000 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Vox+Dei\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
