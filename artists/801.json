Dååth was started by Eyal Levi (guitar), Michael Kameron (vocals, keyboard) and Sean Farberin in 2003, who had been playing in bands since they were in high-school. The three friends attended the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston, but eventually left school to concentrate full-time on their musical endeavours. \n\nDååth (pronounced /ˈdɑːθ/) is a Hebrew word meaning “knowledge”, referring to a knowledge not regularly attained by the masses, according to keyboardist and conceptualist Michael Kameron: “On a mental level, Dååth acts as a doorway between instinct and intellect, and in our opinion the struggle between those two aspects of mind is what causes most of the ills in this world.” Despite its religious meaning, the name does not imply the religious beliefs of the band.\n\n2. Daath is a Depressive Black Metal from Brazil. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Daath\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
