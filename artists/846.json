A sophomore effort, Apology Accepted, followed in 2003, but was never officially released.\n\nIn 2004, guitarist Eddie \"The Kydd\" Rendini made an online statement to Digital Noise, saying:\n\nI think it is time to let everyone know what exactly is going on with DWR. DWR is officially broken up. We all decided to follow new musical endeavors after a very long and complicated legal battle. So i just wanted to take the time to thank all of our fans for sticking with us, and support us in our new musical endeavors. As for the \"Apology Accepted\" album, it is currently done and we will try to put that out for all you DWR fans, as our last offering for a while. Thanks for your support... and remember its never the end.. but just always new beginnings! -Edward\n\nAfter the band's breakup both Jabe and Joe started a new band called 75 Winters. They have since disbanded as well. As well around this time, Rendini joined the Jacksonville, FL band Cold, only to leave later that year.\n\nIn 2005, bassist Alex Cando joined the Louisville, KY band Five Bolt Main, featuring former Flaw vocalist Chris Volz. The band called it quits in late 2006 when Flaw made the decision to reunite. Cando then joined Flaw for their reunion tour, only to part ways with them in mid-2007. He is now playing bass for the Illinois band Silence Is Broken.\n\nIn 2009 Grimm began recording a new music project with South Florida producer Ozny, of New Era.\n\nGrimm - emcee\nJabe - vocals\nEddie The Kydd - guitar\nAlex Cando - bass\nJoe Perrone - drums <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Darwin%27s+Waiting+Room\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
