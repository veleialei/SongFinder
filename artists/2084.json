In the 50s he was busy playing and learning from Babe Stovall, Polka Dot Slim and his friend Slim Harpo. \n\nLittle Freddie is a feature artist at the French Quarter Festival and New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival each year, besides bringing his whiskey soaked Juke Joint style to Europe, once in awhile. \nListen to his music, kick back a beer and enjoy American roots blues.   <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Little+Freddie+King\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
