Death to all false Fortitude. \n\n2.- Adam Fortitude (a.k.a. Fortitude) is a producer/DJ UK based Hard drum & bass. Attempting to create his own take on this exciting form of the previously despised 'dance music' was the next logical step for such an unashamedly musical soul and \nthe next few years....and right up until the present day... were spent learning, sampling, reading, tweaking, watching, obsessing, talking about and breathing drum \nand bass. Djing regularly locally alongside Consistent Motion and Transition as part of KZSS was interrupted by Fortitude relocating to Devon for a year and then to \nVancouver for a further year where he became a nocturnal creature of habit and every day was spent either in work or in the studio.....or both.\n\nSoon people bagan to take notice and a slew of neurofunk and techstep releases followed on labels such as Trust in Music, Section 8, Close 2 Death and Extent \nRecordings along with spending many a day and night travelling on buses and sleeping on floors whilst gigging around the uk. Frequently working on projects with long \ntime friend Terror Cell they proceded to bring their own inimitable style to the unsuspecting, god fearing masses slowly establishing a dark and seedy back catalogue \nincluding the truly insane DEATHNOTE (released on Tantrum Recordings) nestled snugly on an EP with scene heavyweights Dj Hidden and Cooh, the brutal NO PEACE (Section \n8 Recordings) and a few naughty tracks and remixes for labels such as Ex Machina, DeathSoundBat and SCPTX. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fortitude\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
