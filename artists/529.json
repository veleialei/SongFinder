CL Smooth remained musically inactive.\n\nThe pair managed to reconcile their differences only long enough to record five isolated tracks in the ten years since their split: \"Da Two\", \"Back On Da Block\", \"Fly 'Til I Die\", \"Appreciate\", and \"It's A Love Thing.\" There were talks of a definitive reunion and a new album in 2004; however, the speculation was dismissed by both parties after another fallout.\n\nDuring his period of hiatus, CL Smooth declined even to appear as a guest on other artists' albums, with the exception of \"Only the Strong Survive\" with DJ Krush in 1996. Recently, however, he has contributed featured guest vocals to songs by AZ (\"Magic Hour\") and Dipset affiliate J.R. Writer (the remix of \"Mesmerize\").\n\nHe is currently signed to the Shaman Work Recordings label, with whom he and producer Mike Lowe have released the singles \"American Me\", \"Warm Outside\", \"Smoke In The Air\" and \"I Can't Help It\". A music video was made for \"Smoke In The Air\" by production group Bin Bin High. He plans to release his debut solo album, American Me, on October 10th, 2006. To promote the album, Shaman Work released a promotional mixtape compiled by DJ J Period called Man On Fire in late April 2006, featuring 36 minutes of freestyles and a remixed version of the track \"Impossible\".\n\nIn 2008 he released the Multi Barz of Fury EP. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/C.L.+Smooth\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
