Baby Grand was started by Eric Bazilian and Rob Hyman and put out two albums on Arista Records. Self titled in 1977 and \"Ancient Medicine\" in 1978. After Baby Grand split up Eric and Rob formed another band called The Hooters.\n\n2. Sacramento, California’s Baby Grand has existed in one incarnation or another for many years, formed from the ashes of a pop trio whose songs regularly featured serial killers, car accidents and murderous robots. Moving on to happier subjects, the band's debut album 'Spectrum' was released in 2002.\n\n'Coming True' (2007), the long overdue follow-up to 'Spectrum', has seen the band undergo several line-up and instrumentation changes. It's still smart, sophisticated pop, but with a much bigger yet softer sound.\n\n'Lights Are Getting Low' (2008) picks up where 'Coming True' left off, while elevating the band to a new level with lush strings and vibrant horns.\n\n'Arts & Leisure' (2012) is the fourth release by Baby Grand and its most diverse and realized release to date. While continuing their tradition of beautifully orchestrated pop songs in the vein of groups such as Belle & Sebastian and Camera Obscura, this album brings more of the band’s influences to the forefront, and breaks out of the indie pop mold with songs that run the gamut from country waltzes to 1960s-era folk and girl group sounds. \n\n‘Arts & Leisure’ was recorded at Retrofit Studios by Tony Cale (The English Singles), and mastered by Dana Gumbiner (Death Ray).\n\nInfluences : \nThe Zombies, Teenage Fanclub, Pernice Brothers, Belle & Sebastian, Yo La Tengo, Sloan, Kirsty MacColl, Apples In Stereo, The Minders, The Shins, The Shangri-Las, The Beatles, The Go-Betweens, The Kinks, Elliott Smith, Beach Boys, Travis, Duncan Browne, Claudine Longet, Dolly Mixture, Donovan... <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Baby+Grand\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
