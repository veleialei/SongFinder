The album represents the eagerly awaited follow-up to Bermudez’ Latin GRAMMY winning album Todo El Año which further established the young artist as a leader among Latin Music’s new generation of singer-songwriters by garnering three nominations and taking home the award for Best Male Pop Vocal Album.\n\nBorn in the mountain town of Aibonito, Puerto Rico and named after his uncle, Obie’s family moved to the farmlands of Vineland, New Jersey just before his teens. Music actually wasn't his first passion -- it was poetry. He learned guitar from his father, a big Beatles fan, while also being influenced by his mother's lively salsa sounds. Soon, he brought his two loves of words and music together, recording a demo in 1996 that led to an international label deal and the release of his debut album Locales two years later. \n\nThough he received some acclaim, that first album didn't make him an overnight star; Obie chose to step back from his career and took a job at a New York Laundromat in the South Bronx, where his life and that of customers and co-workers inspired the songs that would fill his second album, Confesiones, released by EMI International in 2004. The album’s lead single \"Antes\" topped Latin charts worldwide and lead to Confesiones receiving multiple Latin GRAMMY nominations.\n\nObie next followed with the award-winning Todo El Año, a rich collection touched by personal experience and reflection, offering further heartfelt and soulful tales as the vivid title track shot to #1, and the album’s Latin Grammy win followed.\n\nNow, Obie Bermúdez returns to the Latin Pop landscape once again with Lo Que Trajo El Barco (“What The Ship Has Brought In”).  Working with multiple-Grammy winning producers Sebastian Krys and Andres Castro, Obie describes the album as a musical growth that still maintains his distinctive style and sound and provides a reminder that \"No matter how much we move ahead in our lives and modify ourselves, we still need life’s basic anchors of hope, faith, and charity towards others”.   \n\nOn the new album, a host of accomplished players took part in the sessions, including Fania All-Stars bassist Sal Cuevas, Sergio George percussionist Luis Quintero, renowned drummer Lee Levin, and famed Brazilian percussionist Laercio Da Costa. Producer Krys says the music is combination of Puerto Rican rhythms and the rich landscape of New York, with a story behind every song. The first single “Sigo Con Ella” (I’m Still With Her), is a song of devotion and dreams derived from the one you love.\n\nAll Music Guide has praised Obie for his original arrangements and sheer musical integrity, \"a sonic palette rich with acoustic flavor and a tasteful mix of his Latino and alt-rock influences, an artist not only willing to take risks, but delighting in them.\"  As he said the historic night he won his Grammy, “Nothing is impossible.\" For Obie Bermudez.\" making music is all about seizing the day, in fact, the moment, to find creative vigor and purpose.  He told the Times, \"I've always said that opportunities come around again and again. The important thing is not to be caught sitting on your hands when it comes.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Obie+Berm%C3%BAdez\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
