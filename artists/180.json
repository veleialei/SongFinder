She was born on December 25, 1954 in Aberdeen, Scotland.\n\nAfter three years as lead singer of The Tourists, Lennox achieved her most notable fame as the alto, soul-tinged lead singer of the 1980s rock duo Eurythmics with British musician Dave Stewart. Early in the Eurythmics' career, she was known for her androgyny, wearing suits and once impersonating Elvis. Journalists often referred to her as \"the white Grace Jones\".\n\nHer 1992 album Diva won critical praise and sold well, but her profile decreased for a period due to her desire to raise her two children outside of the media's glare, although she continued to be a major figure in popular music. Medusa - an album of covers in which Lennox tackled songs by everyone from Bob Marley to The Clash - was released three years after Diva, and also sold well. In 1997 she re-recorded the Eurythmics track \"Angel\" for the Diana, Princess of Wales tribute album. In 1998 - following the death of a mutual friend (former The Tourists leader singer/songwriter Peet Coombes) - she re-established contact with Dave Stewart and by 1999, Eurythmics had reformed for the album Peace. In 2003 she released her third solo album, Bare.\n\nIn 2003, Lennox was chosen to record \"Into the West\" for the soundtrack of The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. This song won an Academy Award for Best Song in 2003.\n\nIn October 2007, Annie released her fourth solo album, Songs Of Mass Destruction.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Annie+Lennox\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
