One of the acts on the legendary indie label Sarah Records, The Orchids play pop in its purest and most engaging form. The band formed in the mid-1980s in Penilee, near Govan, in South Glasgow, releasing two full-length studio albums plus a string of EPs and singles. After Sarah dissolved in 1995 the band packed it in, but reformed to record a comeback album and also resumed gigging, with a breathtaking comeback performance at London's Luminaire in March 2007. Their latest album The Lost Star was released on Pebble Records in October 2010.\n\n2. The Orchids, from Coventry, United Kingdom, are sometimes referred to as \"the only true girl group of the 1960s\", as the group's member (Pamela Jarman, Valerie Jones and the bespectacled Georgina Oliver) were 15-year old schoolgirls when they appeared on the scene. Singles include 'Oo Chang-A-Lang' and 'Love Hit Me' and 'I've Got That Feeling'. The Orchids were launched in the United States as The Blue Orchids, due to the existence of a set of American Orchids on the Roulette label, and (in 1965) re-launched in America as The Exceptions.\n\n3. The Orchids are also an as yet unsigned Manchester 6-piece indie group. They combine the songwriting and vocal talents of Jonny Holland and Pete Swift to create epic pop songs. Featuring the idiosyncratic guitar work of Stu Winnington, the melodic keyboard of Dave Renfrew and a powerful rhythm section of drummer Jordan Hunstone and bassist Matthew Herod, the group write music that stirs the soul.\n\n4. The Orchids are also a female hip-hop duo on Japan's Major Force label. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Orchids\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
