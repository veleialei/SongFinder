punk rock band\n\n(1) Formed in the summer of 2000, they won the Belgian National Humo Rock Rally which led to a live session on the Belgian Radio One and MTV equivalent. Later in 2002 they recorded the debut single 'Audience' with producer Teo Miller (Placebo - Nancy Boy). In 2006 they released their first full album 'Bring It On' (on the Skint label).\nDave Martijn was the temporary tour bassist for fellow Belgian band Soulwax whilst on the promotional tour for 'Any Minute Now' between 2004-2006.\n\nGoose started out as a AC/DC cover band, but they quickly found their own agenda by absorbing great amount of synth into the musical system. Belgium is located just between France and Germany – and in the same manner, Goose are the sound of an intense duel between Kraftwerk and Daft Punk at a lay-by in the Benelux.\nwebsite: http://www.goosemusic.com\nmyspace page: http://www.myspace.com/goosemusic\n\n(2) Post- Rock Band from Thailand :\n5 guys who have a unique style of Rock and Electronic music plus a new concept of modern point of view. Their work is a piece of art. “Goose” is a talented band that has a professional skill of playing\nlive music.   (words from www.smallroom.co.th)\n\nFormed in 2002, consist of 5 friends who share the same passion for music: Nares Vorojtanachai (Vox, guitar), Bancha Thearakrit (guitar), Annop Musigapodok (Guitar), Anupas Premanuwat (bass) and drummer Apichart Ngamloet. In 2004, the band was nominated for Best New Artist at the Fat Awards by Bangkok’s largest Indie radio station (104.5 Fat Radio) and made a significant mark in the Thai Indie scene. Goose offered a distinct delicate mixture of shoegaze psychedelic sound with strong originality. The success and progress of this distinct post-rock sound continued in their second album 20 Guns pointing in your Face released by Smallroom records. Their musical identity grew stronger as did their popularity. Goose was named the Best Group at the Fat Awards 2005. \n\nWebsite: http://www.myspace.com/verygoose \n\n\n(3) Formed in 1998 from a collection of talented jazz and funk musicians from the Adelaide professional music scene.
