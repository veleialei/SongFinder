The first is a band from Ontario, Canada on Brightside Records...\nFormed in 1994, Curtis released 2 full length records throughout the course of the next 5 years. After taking a long hiatus, they finally re-emerged in 2004 with a live in the studio record featuring 2 brand new tracks. The band is currently in the studio working on their 3rd full length record and will be touring in support of it throughout 2005/2006.\nSinger/guitarist Siegfried Meier is a Producer, Engineer and Mixer that has worked with Kittie, Thine Eyes Bleed, Blue Skies At War, Tom Araya of Slayer, Scotty James, Chuck Ragan of Hot Water Music, Seconds To Go, The Soap Opera Coma, Kover, Machete Avenue, Matthew Johnston, Jersey, The Salads, Holly McNarland, Dayna Manning, among many others. \n\n2. The second Curtis released a stomping disco tune in 1979 called \"How Can I Tell Her\" (some call it northern soul for some strange reason - perhaps it was played in some of the British clubs alongside northern soul songs). An original copy of this record on 7\" or 12\" will fetch a substantial amount of money due to it's rareness (and greatness). It was released on the Baltimore, Maryland based indie label, Charm City. \n\n3. The third...\n\nCurtis Fornadley, (who only uses his first name professionally) is a guitar player and native of southern California. \nHis band, Rob Chismar (drums) originally from Detroit and Dave Hill (bass) from Seattle have been in L.A. long enough to call it home. \n\nCurtis released his self-titled debut CD in 1998 and his second CD, \"Room 137\" in 2001.\nIn 2005 Guitar Instrumentalist Curtis released his third CD Blue Electric Cool, a captivating mix of instrumental rock, acid jazz and surf.  Blue Electric Cool takes the instrumental guitar genre a step further.  A new CD from Curtis is due out Fall 2007.\n\n4. Fourth is rapper 50 Cent. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Curtis\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
