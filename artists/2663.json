He more recently stood in on vocals on a tour with Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen as a new collaboration titled Queen + Paul Rodgers. On this tour, Paul stressed that he was not trying to replace the band's deceased singer, Freddie Mercury, but tried his best to give his own style to the songs.\n\nQueen and Paul parted ways amicably in 2009, with Paul remarking that he would like to get back together in the future to raise money for charity. Paul has since reunited with Bad Company, and they toured in 2010. Over the years, he's also successfully toured and released albums with his own group centered around him. Paul is ranked number 55 on Rolling Stone magazine's \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\". His work has been long influenced by American blues and rock n roll, and he helped play a role in the 70s arena rock and hard rock scenes both in the U.K. and the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Rodgers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
