The album was critically acclaimed for blending elements of progressive metal, thrash, and hardcore with their metalcore sound.\n\nIn early 2006, the band announced that long-time guitarist Jon Starr would be leaving the band due to pursuing a career in recording. He was replaced with Alex Kenis of the death metal band Aletheian. The band also announced that they would be writing new material in the Spring.\n\nIt was announced on July 30, that longtime guitarist Sean Cunningham will be leaving the band to pursue his last semester in college and pursue a full-time career.\n\nIn late 2011, the remaining founding members Jason Wisdom (bass, vocals) and Brandon \"Duck\" Duckett (drums) left the band.\n\nLINEUP\n\nSeth Hecox – rhythm guitar\nDaniel Gailey – lead guitar\nChris McCane - vocals\nCodey Watkins - bass\nChris Heaton - drums <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Becoming+the+Archetype\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
