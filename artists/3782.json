A New Wave of British Heavy Metal band from Oxford, United Kingdom, founded in 1981.\n2. A female gospel group from New Orleans, founded in 1997.\n\n\n1) Virtue (Oxford, UK)\n\nVirtue was a NWOBHM band formed in 1981. They released a 7\" titled 'We Stand to Fight' in 1985 on Other Records. The 'Fool's Gold' demo was released independently by the band in 1987 on cassette tape when the originally planned vinyl EP failed to come to fruition due to financial issues and label complications.\n\nThe band's first demo Virtue-Defenders was released on tape in 1984: At that time the band consisted of the Sheldon brothers Matt and Tudor, Metcalfe, Reader and Lewington. As the result wasn't satisfying the band almost split-up. The lineup was almost completely revamped then, with the Sheldon brothers being the only remaining members. \n\n\n1) Virtue (New Orleans, LA)\n\nVirtue, a sophisticated trio recognized as women of high standard and impeccable grace are known within the music industry for their beauty and cutting edge style. Looks are not deceiving when it comes to these three. If their beauty draws you to them, the depth of their message will satisfy your soul. Hailing from New Orleans, LA, the group promotes a message of faith, hope, and positive self image through their music and personal lifestyles. We need to let women know that its time to stand up for what is right. We have to dress, talk, and act like women who are mothers, sisters, wives and even girlfriends. Speaking of girlfriends, the members of Virtue are not only biological sisters, but also friends. They affectionately refer to themselves and their close knit girlfriend circle as H.A.G.G.S. Don't be alarmed, though, it's not because they don't think highly of themselves or their friends. It's actually quite opposite. HAGGS is a term of endearment reserved solely for the Honorable Ambitious Gifted Gorgeous Sista who upholds the belief that it is time to stop being mundane and do something great. \n\nIn addition to their gospel music projects, Virtue is also establishing the Virtuegirl network that seeks to mentor other young women toward positive personal enrichment. Often compared to the soulful styling of En Vogue and Destinys Child, the group comprised of sisters, Ebony Trotter Holland, Karima Trotter Kibble, and Heather Trotter Martin, continue to remind us that they are dedicated to leadership by example. The Dove and Stellar Award nominees have 5 successful projects to their credit with the 6th album, Testimony, that was released in 2006 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Virtue\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
