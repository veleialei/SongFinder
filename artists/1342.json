He was the host of the late-night talk show Lopez Tonight on TBS until its cancellation on August 12, 2011.\n\n\n     George Lopez was born to a Mexican-American family and grew up in the San Fernando Valley near Los Angeles, California. He became a popular stand-up comedian, especially among the Latino community for his satirizing of Mexican-American life and culture in the United States. Much of his humor was drawn from the financial poverty of his upbringing and of the Latino community in general. He has released four albums of recorded stand-up comedy shows, including Right Now Right Now and Team Leader, which was nominated for a 2004 Grammy for Best Comedy Album. [1] He appeared in The Latin Kings of Comedy, where he was special guest along with other top Latino stand-up comedians. Alien Nation in 1996 was his first album released of his stand-up comedy shows. His current stand-up comedy DVD is Why You Crying?. He recently released \"El Mas Chingon\" in September of 2006.\n\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/George+Lopez\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
