An alias of DJ Hazard\n2. A  British rock singer (The one and only Miss Dirty Harry)\n3. A New York Blend DJ\n4. A Belgian new-beat formation\n\n2. Born in London, Harry spent her early life living in Singapore and New York as well as in the UK, and was raised under strict conservative family values – a vicar grandfather and mother in charge of a local Sunday school. At a young age she turned her back on this strict background and alongside Madonna, Harry connected with singers like Patti Smith and Janis Joplin – great influences in both her youth and musical stylings.\n\nAs she grew up, Harry became more and more involved in the London music scene, throwing herself into the social scene at early age. She first experienced the London nightlife at 14 – frequenting the club circuit and London fetish clubs Torture Garden and Slimelight in particular – earning her ‘Dirty’ tag along the way and building a reputation for herself on the underground music scene before launching a music career of her own.\n\nShe appeared on Tommy Lee's album Tommyland: The Ride in the track Makin Me Crazy. She also sang vocals on Cradle of Filth's song  Temptation, from the album Thornography, which is a cover of the Heaven 17 song.\n\nVictoria 'Dirty Harry/Harry' Harrison now DJs as The Amazonica.\n\n4.  Belgian New beat formation featuring Praga Khan & Co. real names...\nMembers:\tHarry Van Oekel, Jos Borremans, Maurice Engelen\nthey had 2 big hits in the new beat period in belgium : D'Bob   and Double D <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dirty+Harry\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
