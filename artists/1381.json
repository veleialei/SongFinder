The group owner was initially Floyd Beck. Bass singer Tim Riley would replace Gilliland as the permanent bass singer in July of that same year after the group's relocation to Gadsden, Alabama. The group was an instant success in the industry, appearing on the main stage of the National Quartet Convention in October 1981. By 1982, tenor Brian Free, lead Ivan Parker, and pianist Garry Jones had joined Riley to form a consistent nucleus that remained together until the mid-1990s. Their recordings of upbeat tunes like “I Think I’ll Read It Again” and inspirational songs like “No Other Word For Grace But Amazing” and “Midnight Cry” catapulted the group into the upper ranks of Southern Gospel. The last recording by this popular lineup was the critically acclaimed Acapella Gold (1993).\n\n The 1990s\n\nAfter the departure of Free, Jones and Parker, baritone, Steve Lacey took over lead duties, while Mark Trammell became baritone, and Jay Parrack became tenor. Lacey left to join The Kingdom Heirs. David Hill became lead singer for a while. His departure lead to the next consistent lineup for the group which included Jonathan Wilburn singing lead, Mark Trammell singing baritone, and Jay Parrack on tenor. Over the years, the group developed a trademark style that relied on brass heavy arrangements for their more driving songs and moving lyrics for their inspirational anthems.\n\n Recent History\n\nThe last few years have brought a period of change and transition to this legendary quartet. Many personnel changes in the front line, as well as the breakup of the Band of Gold have given a new look, as well as a new sound to the group. The most notable, and tragic change occurred in 2006, when Doug Riley, who co-managed Gold City (in addition to playing drums before taking over running the sound when the group streamlined their operations),was killed in an auto accident on the way to the recording studio early in the morning of January 31, after not being able to sleep.\n\nIn March 2006, bass singer Bill Lawrence (who had been hand picked by former bass, Tim Riley) left the group. Tim Riley filled in for several months while the search for a replacement was underway. Aaron McCune, who at the time was the bass singer with the Palmetto State Quartet, joined Gold City in May 2006. McCune brings to Gold City the trademark smoothness and deep range that has long been a standard for this quartet.\n\nIn February 2007, it was announced that the group had returned to The Beckie Simmons Agency from The Harper Agency. Beckie Simmons, while at Century II and her own agency, has handled the quartet's bookings for the majority of its existence.\nFull Gold City Discography\n\n    * 1981 First Day In Heaven\n    * 1981 We Believe\n    * 1981 Sing Golden Nuggets\n    * 1981 Songs Of Days Gone By\n    * 1982 I've Got A Feeling\n    * 1982 Gold City: Live\n    * 1983 I Think I’ll Read It Again\n    * 1983 Hymns Sung By The Gold City Quartet\n    * 1983 Higher Than The Moon\n    * 1984 or 1984 Walking With Jesus\n    * 1984 Walk On\n    * 1985 Sing With The Angels\n    * 1986 Gold City Gold\n    * 1986 Double Take: Live\n    * 1986 Your Favorite Hymns\n    * 1986 Top Hits Volume 1\n    * 1986 Top Hits Volume 2\n    * 1987 Favorites Volume 1\n    * 1987 Favorites Volume 2\n    * 1987 Favorites Volume 3\n    * 1987 Movin’ Up\n    * 1988 Portrait\n    * 1988 Voices Of Christmas\n    * 1989 Chartbreakers Volume 1\n    * 1989 Chartbreakers Volume 2\n    * 1989 Favorite Hymns Volume 2\n    * 1989 Goin’ Home\n    * 1990 Windows of Home\n    * 1990 Instrumentals Volume 1\n    * 1990 Indiana Live\n    * 1990 Favorites Volume 4\n    * 1990 Chart Breakers Volume 3\n    * 1991 Super 70’s Gospel Hits Vol. 1\n    * 1991 Super 70’s Gospel Hits Vol. 2\n    * 1991 Super 70’s Gospel Hits Vol. 3\n    * 1991 10 Year Celebration\n    * 1991 Answer The Call\n    * 1992 Kings Gold\n    * 1992 Masters of the Gospel\n    * 1992 Pillars of Faith\n    * 1993 Kings Gold 2\n    * 1993 Acapella Gold\n    * 1993 Requested Hymns Volume 1\n    * 1993 Requested Hymns Volume 2\n    * 1993 Requested Hymns Volume 3\n    * 1994 Renewed\n    * 1994 Lord Do It Again\n    * 1994 Classics\n    * 1994 Kings Gold 3\n    * 1995 Standing In The Gap\n    * 1996 Kings Gold 4\n    * 1996 Having Fun\n    * 1996 Preparing The Way\n    * 1997 What A Great Lifestyle\n    * 1997 Home For The Holidays\n    * 1998 The Collection\n    * 1998 Within The Rock\n    * 1999 Signed, Sealed, Delivered\n    * 1999 Amazing Grace: A Hymn Collection\n    * 2000 20th Anniversary Celebration: Vol. 1\n    * 2000 20th Anniversary Celebration: Vol. 2\n    * 2000 Are You Ready?\n    * 2000 Through The Years\n    * 2001 Pressed Down, Shaken Together, Running Over\n    * 2002 The Very Best of Gold City\n    * 2002 Camp Meetin'\n    * 2003 Walk the Talk\n    * 2003 24K Gold\n    * 2003 Pillars of Faith/Acapella (Double Album Reissue)\n    * 2003 A Gold City Christmas\n    * 2004 First Class\n    * 2005 Heaven\n    * 2006 Gold City - Their Best\n    * 2006 Revival\n    * 2007 Classics Volume 2 (unofficial title, upcoming release featuring new cuts of Gold City standards\n    * 2008 Moment of Truth <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gold+City\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
