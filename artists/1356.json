Ivan’s band, Motograter (Elektra), was set to perform live on-air at XM Radio. Stevens, an XM Radio producer and guitar player (Winter’s Bane/The Clay People), was taken in by Ivan’s vocals and felt he would be a natural fit for material he had been working on since the disbanding of his former project. Stevens presented his material to Ivan and the two instantly began their musical partnership.\n\nAfter a few late night studio sessions, Ivan and Stevens realized they had something special. They soon began assembling the musical ensemble that would help make their vision become to reality.\n\nThe two visionaries did not have to look far to find Chris “Crispy” Binns of Motograter to handle the precision drumming requirements for the project. Being a seasoned veteran, Crispy brings an infectious drive to the material along with an impeccable meter.\n\nSoon after, the band enlisted, Brett “Wingnut” Davis to take on the electronics, programming and keyboards. Wingnut was a natural choice and immediate fit with his prior experience, musical sense and his use of cutting edge technology.\n\nThe final addition was Mike “Mikey” McLaughlin on bass and bass synth detail. Along with his unique use of effects on bass, Mikey also brought his years of touring and business sense to help round out the project.\n\nThe band recently completed its first self-titled CD, which was engineered and co-produced by Pete Murray (Lo-Pro/Ultraspank).\n\n“This is the most positive musical experience I have ever been a part of,” says Ivan. ”There is so much excitement about what we are creating. I can’t wait for everyone else to hear this…”\n\nWhile being influenced by sounds of NINE INCH NAILS, THE CURE, PINK FLOYD, ALICE IN CHAINS, TOOL and MINISTRY, Ghost Machine has managed to paint its own portrait of an electronic emotionally rich landscape while still capturing the edge and raw energy that is heavy rock. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ghost+Machine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
