Shortly after this release bassist Barmy Faliure left, and Lewsor took to solo duties. The band is currently on hiatus whilst Lewsor concentrates on making solo material for his upcoming album 'No Error Its Lewsor', and hopefully finds another musician to join Extasick. More recently, a two newer tune has appeared called Impratical Minefields and a cover of Atari Teenage Riot's song No Remorse (I Wanna Die)on the group's myspace and a new album enititled Overdose may be released sometime in the near future. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Extasick\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
