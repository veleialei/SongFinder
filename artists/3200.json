New wave, punk and disco may have had their own fervent -and very separate- followings, but they had more in common than each cared to admit.\n\n“People weren't afraid to have bad haircuts, or wear day glow or sing about ants invading,\" says singer/songwriter Susan Hyatt - the steamy yet strong female presence of Stimulator.\n\nStimulator’s quirky retro feel (which helped them score high profile gigs with the likes of\nBerlin & Missing Persons) is just one layer here. Make no mistake, this is a thoroughly modern musical unit with an impressive array of credentials and an understanding of technology's ever-evolving role in music.\n\nSusan Hyatt, not only had a Top 20 single in the UK with her grungy-rock group Pillbox, she was also a well-known VJ on Londons' MP3TV. More recently, she served as a consultant to Gina Gershon for the girl rock flick \"Prey For Rock n' Roll.\"\n\n\nGeoff Tyson, the songwriter/producer of Stimulator, best known as the former ax-man for gloomy grinders Snake River Conspiracy, but before that his riff skills were honed and refined by the best: he's worked in the studio with the likes of Mike Shipley and Eric Valentine and he's a former protégée of none other than guitar god Joe Satriani. Geoff Tyson plays Duesenberg guitars.\n\nWhen these two get together it's pure alchemy. Pulsating electro-pop melodies, razor sharp licks and attitude-laden vocals (not to mention Hyatt's often outrageous, DIY stage outfits) make for a, well, stimulating experience.\n\nBlow up dolls, S&M (physical and emotional) and a tell-it-like it-is take on materialism are just a few of the images and themes that pierce through the band's aggressive yet bubbly cuts.\n\nIt’s their infectious sound that's won over the likes ofKerrang (UK) and LA Weekly (US), the CMJ Festival and its what will ultimately garner fans of all tastes and age ranges- even the kiddies. Stimulator did a wonderfully wicked cover of “Magic” in the Disney film “Ella Enchanted” made famous by none-the-other than the aforementioned 70s/80s goddess herself Ms. Olivia. Promoter Kevin Lyman personally invited them on theWest Coast leg of the 2004 WARPED Tour.\n\nCatch Stimulator opening for Duran Duran on their Summer '05 US Arena Tour!\n\nThe debut CD will be released on The Lab/Universal Records out February 2006.\n\nStimulator are also the hard trance duo P. van Schooten & E. van de Witte, who have had numerous big releases on UK hard dance label, Tidy. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stimulator\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
