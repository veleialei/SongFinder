Dino, (born Dino Esposito on July 20, 1963), is an American DJ, singer, songwriter and producer.\n\nDino earned his Bachelor's Degree in Communications/Broadcasting and Music at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Shortly after, he received a job as a radio DJ at his college radio station as the program director with his own morning show called Urban Sunrise. Later becoming a Top 40 deejay at Nevada's Power 97 station, he was offered a job at KCEP, Las Vegas' largest black music station, eventually becoming its music director. During this time he also moonlighted as a local club DJ.\n\nDino then became a singer, first as part of the musical group Esquire, and later as a solo artist recording song hits during the late 1980s, including \"I Like It\", \"24/7\", \"Summer Girls\" and \"Romeo.\" In the initial up-swing of his career Dino performed in theme parks such as Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, California with other artists such as Sweet Sensation and Linear. Eventually his album 24/7 reached the number 34 position on the Billboard 200 charts in 1989. Dino developed a wider fanbase when he was contracted to become the opening act for the musical group New Kids on the Block in the summer of that same year. He was signed to Island Records before moving on to East West Records in 1993. Under the Island Record label he formed his own production label, ONID Productions, which is his name spelled backward.\n\nAfter his singing career, he began producing and songwriting with other artists such as Tonya Mitchell, Paul Taylor, Jordan Knight, Walter Beasley, Sheena Easton, and Joanna Pacitti, whose collaborative song \"Watch Me Shine\" was released on the Legally Blonde motion picture soundtrack.\n\nDino is currently married to Caroline Jackson, one of the original members of the singing group The Cover Girls.\n\n*****************************************************************************************************************\n\n2. Dino - Portuguese Soul and Funk singer.\n\nIf Dino’s childhood was a canvas, it would certainly be painted in an expressionist style, just like in the art movement, the harsh reality that Dino had in front of him was metamorphosed in the smooth perception he had of it. Like many of the emigrant families that came from Africa, Pereira family didn’t have a good life on the first years of adaptation to Portugal. 1982 was when Dino first used his voice, still in the doctor’s arms, just out of his mother’s womb. His interest on music was awake from a very early age, either linked to church, where he seldom performed in choirs, either linked to friends.\nHis first recordings were on the final of the 90’s, with a group of friends that named themselves as Opiniao Publica (Public Opinion) and, later on, in the Casa da Poesia (a name of a venue). This allied to the fact that in the end of the year of 1999 he met a young man called Samuel Mira, worked as a magic invigorating potion for his future. It was the start of a link that both still not knew the importance of it.\nAfter his teenage years, Dino appeared on Operacao Triunfo (a sort of XFactor competition program that was broadcast on RTP) and becoming part of the Jaguar Band (2003/2004), the band that accompanies Expensive Soul. Many collaborations with different artists followed. After many years of those collaborations on projects that were mainly of others, he finally decides to start producing his own album, that puts all of his musical influences together. It was recorded and edited by Vitor Silva on the Vibe Zone studios.\n\nThe album was edited in by EDEL’s sub-label called QUARTO MÁGICO, whose frontman is, nine years later on, the same Samuel Mira that we all know as Sam the Kid.\n\n*****************************************************************************************************************\n\n3.
