Later, Edwards and McKinney met guitarist and blues harp player, Joe Dolce, and formed a band that was to become the most popular blues-rock band in Southern Ohio, The Headstone Circus (later to change its name to Sugar Creek in 1967, after recording its only album, Please Tell a Friend.) Shortly afterwards, Edwards left the band to do solo acoustic music. He recorded \"Sunshine\" after having accidentally erased another song intended for a solo self-titled album. \"Sunshine\" ultimately became a Billboard #4 pop hit during the early-1970s period of anti-war protests and rejection of authority.\n\nAfter taking a turn into mainstream country music, Edwards left the business and moved to Nova Scotia, where he bought a farm. By 1976, however, he was back in the music scene, singing backup on Emmylou Harris's second album, Elite Hotel. After three more solo albums and another break, he joined bluegrass band The Seldom Scene, recording a single album with them before trying his hand at children's music with Little Hands.\n\nReturning to country music in 1989, he released The Natural Thing, which provided his biggest country hit to date, \"We Need to Be Locked Away\". He continues to record albums and, as of June 2007, is still touring. He has also produced albums for Cheryl Wheeler.\n\nreleased Cd's-\n1971 Jonathan Edwards Atco \n1972 Honky-Tonk Stardust Cowboy Collector's Choice \n1973 Have a Good Time for Me Collector's Choice \n1974 Lucky Day (live) Wounded Bird Records \n1976 Rockin' Chair Wounded Bird Records \n1977 Sailboat Wounded Bird Records \n1980 Live!
