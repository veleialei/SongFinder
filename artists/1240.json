The band's original lineup consisted of vocalist Jack Vigliatura IV, guitarist Travis Tooke, drummer Jay Russell and bassist Bill White. Explaining the band's name, Vigliatura once stated: \"We always said we'd play music for squirrels\". In early 1994, they released their first full album, Baypath Road, followed by the Plymouth EP. Eventually, For Squirrels signed with Sony/550 Music, replacing Russell with new drummer Jack Griego and releasing Example on October 3, 1995.\n\nOn September 8, 1995, while returning from playing the CMJ Music Marathon in New York City, the band was involved in the auto accident that killed Vigliatura, White, and Bender. Griego and Tooke suffered multiple injuries but survived the crash.\nThe album was released as planned. The single \"Mighty K.C.\", about the death of Kurt Cobain, was a minor hit and continued to drive album sales.\n\nA few months after the accident, Tooke and Griego regrouped with school friend Andy Lord on bass and Tooke taking over on vocals. In February 1996, the new lineup began by playing a few low-key shows centered around classic For Squirrels songs and a selection of covers under the pseudonym Revlover. Eventually, they resurrected the For Squirrels moniker and began writing and performing new material, favoring a heavier grunge sound. By late 1996, the trio was playing under the name Subrosa. In the summer of 1997, they released their only record under this name, Never Bet the Devil Your Head, on Sony Records, to decent reviews but poor sales. Second guitarist Mike Amish was later added, which was followed by a tour supporting popular alternative rock act Creed. Griego eventually parted ways with the group and was replaced in the band's final years by Rusty Valentine. They disbanded in 2001.\nLater activity.\n\nTooke, Lord and Amish have remained active in the Gainesville rock scene. Tooke has performed under several monikers including his most recent music project, Helixglow. He has also released a solo CD and several singles (2012) via Indigo Planet Records. Amish and Lord now play in the band Papercranes. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/For+Squirrels\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
