A brilliant lyricist and rhymer, he is a rapper's rapper, equally adept at freestyle and the written verse.\n\nGrowing up between Vancouver and Victoria, Birdapres (real name Dane Goulet) evolved from a trouble-making youth to a full time hip-hop fan and participant. From collecting rap 12\"s and cassettes in the late 80's to pressing his first 12\" (with RKV) in 1995, Bird has had an unwavering commitment to the art form that is hip-hop and music in general. He has studied its history and is a walking encyclopedia of recorded music. He can find a funky break in virtually any pile of dollar records. His record collection has something from every era and every genre, and he has made his living as a record dealer at various times in the ebay era.\n\nBirdapres has worked with many notable artists over the years: Moka Only, DJ Moves, Len, Styles of Beyond. But he has also appeared on countless underground releases in and around Vancouver over the years, because the scene respects him and he is always down to work with someone new. This attitude eventually paired him with mcenroe of Peanuts & Corn Records, and led to the formation of mcenroe & Birdapres and the release of Nothing Is Cool. This recording was one of the most popular and best selling releases for Peanuts & Corn, garnering rave reviews and selling very well in Canada. The Nothing Is Cool tour visited 17 cities across Canada, and Birdapres finally saw the size of his fanbase first hand.\n\nIn 2006, Birdapres is dropping his long awaited solo record. \"Get It Done\" is a 12 song opus that shows all sides of Bird's personality - the fun loving \"Do That Dance\", the clubby yet observant \"Bar Star\", the fierce, relentless \"Get It Done\", and the introspective \"The Winter\". It is tied together with the production of mcenroe, and a simple attitude: Get It Done. No gimmicks, no pop hooks, no biting. When Birdapres digs for records, he finds the best ones, regardless of genre or era. Get It Done is music for music lovers. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Birdapres\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
