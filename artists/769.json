The lead singer Bettina has a background as a deejay with taste leaning to both club and pop/rnb music, and as a singer she made her career debut in the Finnish Idols semifinals. She had a contact already with the band boss Joel Kalsi aka. Jole through the deejay scene, but caught his attention through the TV show. \"You never told me you can sing\" he said, and the thought staid alive in the background until Joel decided to sign Bettina as the 'emperesse' in the band. Later Bettina went to impress the crowds on The Voice of Finland with her sister Isabella and they were chosen as the best battle duo by the audience. The third member Olli had been around the music scene in Joel's hood and they had known each others since the wild nineties, which even include several TV live shows with a past live project together, so it was only natural to invite Olli on the on-stage keys. The unforementioned fourth member is Joel's brother-in-arms Ari Myllym√§ki, who mainly co-produces in the studio, but also sometimes takes part on the road and on the shows.\n\nThe band originally came to the public with their song \"Flying High\" (which Joel btw wrote back in 1998 already!), and it gained a number of listeners' downloads and streams in millions world wide. The track spent roughly a total year 2005-2006 on the Finnish Disco Chart and along the FDC it also topped 1 on the Finnish Club Chart.\n\nAfterwards DCX approached ABBA, the biggest influence to disco music ever, in order to have a permission for releasing a cover version of \"Knowing me, knowing you\" and after releasing the song, they went top 5 on the Finnish single chart. This was a sequel entry to their previous singles \"Hold me\" and \"Poor Romeo\", which both also went top 5. The first album also brought singles to the Finnish pop/electronica scene like \"Fortune & Fate\" and \"Don't break my heart\", but also a promo single of \"I feel like\" you, made together with german dance legends known as X-perience!\n\nThe band's (or should we say \"the crew's\", in order to honour all the rock boybands out there) energetic live shows have become their second trademark, right after the sound they bring single after single. The crew has given support on stage for numerous big names like Vinyl Shakerz, Darude, Akcent, NEX, Pandora, Groove Coverage, September, Ian van Dahl, Basic Element, Mr President, Basshunter, Fragma, Tina Cousins, Sylver, X-Perience, Scooter, Velvet, and the list goes on.\n\nIn 2012 DCX contributed to the Finnish Eurovision contest with the song \"Erase You\" and reached places #5, #2 and #1 on the public polls out of all 540 contestants. The latest music video \"Erase You\" was shot right afterwards and went fast over 100,000 views on Youtube.\n\nThe last release has been \"DCX - Flying High : Best Mixes\" compilation and the band is on a break from recording. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/DCX\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
