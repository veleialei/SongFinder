The family name was Bush, but he later added the \"c\" largely for the uniqueness. Blessed with an inherent music talent, he was already leading a ragtime and jazz band Lou Bush and His Tickle Toe Four, by the time he was 12 years old.\n\nHis biggest hits from the 1950s include \"Portuguese Washerwomen\", \"Sam's Song\", a cover of Del Wood's version of \"Down Yonder\", and the international hit \"Zambezi\". Some of the singles include his vocal backup group, the cleverly named The Carr Hopps. Often overlooked are several mainstream and jazz sides he recorded as Lou Busch, featuring exciting band or orchestral arrangements.\n\nOne Busch collaboration with Milton DeLugg, \"Rollercoaster\", became the closing theme of the TV panel show What's My Line? for the entirety of its original network run, from 1950 to 1967. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lou+Busch\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
