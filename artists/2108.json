This is dark electronic pop with crossover potential to rock, trip-hop, ambient, industrial, electro and darkwave - all with a beautiful and emotional sensibility. \n\nTrip-Hop put her on the map with the song, \"MY SOUL SPEAKS.\" Later, LORE is featured with \"LONDON AFTER MIDNGHT\" performing Hebrew vocals on \"BLESSING.\"  SEAN BRENNAN then gets his revenge on LORE's \"HAUNTING\" - a sensual yet hard edge fantasy-like extravaganza that could easily find itself the theme song of a spooky James Bond movie. Overall, the album's lyrics reflect lessons in love, passion for music and spiritual revelation. From the guitar heavy \"LOVE HAS GONE\" defining what BAD-ASS sounds like to the electro pop song \"FLOW\" - these songs entrance the listener with intensity. \"ANGEL\" takes you on a hauntingly beautiful journey. \"WHY DO I\" gives the feeling of a 1940's smoky, avant-garde jazz lounge while \"SINK\" is a burlesque dancers dream and the ambient soundscape of \"RELEASE\" won't leave a dry eye. An amazing debut receiving great reviews!\n\nDEBUT CD REVIEWS!!:\n\n9/10 stars!! - “ORKUS” - Gerrmany/USA\n5/5 Stars!! - “ELEGY IBERICA” - Portugal\n4/5 Stars!! - “DARK CITY” - Russia\n\n\n“A fusion of blissed out programming and dreamy vocals with something dark and dirty lurking underneath.” METAL HAMMER MAGAZINE\n\n\n\"The focus of interest is, without a doubt, a female musician who is walking her own path, with attitude and mainly via darkened alleyways. Past dive bars with film noir flair (Sink) and semi darkened clubs where electro-clash and power pop are the soundtrack to life until the early hours (Flow). The cockles are warmed by the messaging bass, vocally arranged atmospheric songs, and Lore’s special voice that, especially in the lower ranges, gives you goose bumps.\" ORKUS MAGAZINE\n\nLORE - a female artist with a passion for manipulating electronic textures. Her songs and sensual vocals encompass spirituality and love for music. \"My songs express the deepest reflections of my soul.\"  \n\nLORE vocals can be heard on BILLY IDOL'S \"BURIED ALIVE\" included the \"HEAVY METAL 2000\" Soundtrack Album.  \n\nNew LORE material is in deep creation.\n\n\nLORE WEBSITES:\n\nhttp://WWW.LOREMUSIC.COM\nhttp://WWW.MYSPACE.COM/LORE\nhttp://WWW.VAMPIREFREAKS.COM/LOREMUSIC\nhttp://LORE.YUKU.COM (LORE ONLINE COMMUNITY) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lore\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
