Regarded as one of the great folkloric leading ladies of the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, Silvestre is perhaps best-known for starring in the films Primero soy mexicano, El bolero de Raquel, and the Academy Award-nominated drama Ánimas Trujano.\n\nDuring the peak of her career she married her frequent co-star Antonio Aguilar, with whom she procreated the actors and singers Antonio Aguilar Jr. and Pepe Aguilar. Besides being internationally recognized in cinema, Silvestre also became the image of a popular comic book entitled, La Llanera Vengadora.[4] She is the elder sister of singer and actress Enriqueta Jiménez.\n\nFlor Silvestre was born Guillermina Jiménez Chagoya in Salamanca, Guanajuato on August 16, 1929, to Jesús Jiménez Cervantes and María de Jesús Chagoya Peña. She is the third of seven children: Francisco, Raquel, (herself), José Luis, Enriqueta, María de la Luz, and Arturo.\n\nAt the age of 13, Silvestre along with her family moved to central Mexico City, where she began her first steps in her musical career singing such ranchera songs as \"La canción mexicana\", \"Yo también soy mexicana\" and \"El herradero\". She became one of the leading artists in the XFO radio station being heard by the audience singing the song \"La soldadera\", by José de Jesús Morales. After her work in the XFO, Flor won a fan contest in the XEW radio station. She sang in the Teatro Colonial, which was the start for her tour across Central and South America and prior to that chose the stage name of \"Flor Silvestre\" (wild flower), when the Dolores del Río-starred film Flor silvestre was released in theaters in 1943. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Flor+Silvestre\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
