Lusciously filled with captivating and provocative sounds, XCULTURES explores the depth of what is possible when a talented artist surrenders to the passion of making music. Each track is a colorful piece of an exciting mosaic of world instruments, global dance grooves and exotic vocal percussions.\n\t\n\nXCULTURES is a tantalizing collection of songs that shed light on the eclectic spectrum of international sounds, instruments and voices that will be heard around the world, promoting awareness of the great wealth of diversity among our planet's societies. Lusciously filled with captivating and provocative sounds, XCULTURES explores the depth of what is possible when a talented artist surrenders to the passion of making music. Each track is a colorful piece of an exciting mosaic of world instruments, global dance grooves and exotic vocal percussions.\n\nXCULTURES is the realization of Brian Wayy's commitment to participate in ending world hunger. Back in 1990, while driving on Interstate 5 in California, Brian was overwhelmed by a vision. He experienced himself helping to feed the millions of children throughout the world who go to sleep hungry every night and wake up hungry every morning. In that moment, he decided that his passion, the music he creates, would be the vehicle.\n\n\"XCULTURES- One World, One People\" is the result of Brian Wayy's commitment.\n\nPerhaps, for Brian, the most challenging part of the project was assembling the vast array of talent that appears on XCULTURES. It sometimes took as long as three months just to locate some of the artists. This collection takes you from the most advanced societies to the most desolate third world nations, and celebrates through music, the beauty that exists around the globe.\n\nOne third of the artist royalties will be sent directly to CARE, a non-profit organization devoted to wiping out world hunger and poverty. For more information on CARE, their web sight is www.care.org 800-521-CARE.\n  \t\n\n CREDITS\n\nComposed, arranged, produced and recorded by Brian Wayy\n\nWords by Marisa Kosugi, Damien Hamler, Sharzad Moraffah and Brian Wayy\n\nMixed by Franz Pusch and Brian Wayy at M.E.G.
