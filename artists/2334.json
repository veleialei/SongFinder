She is one of the country's most widely recognized and awarded female country singers of the '90s, winning the Canadian Country Music Awards (CCMA) Fans' Choice Entertainer Of The Year Award twice in 1993 & 1995.\nWright's primary success has been in her native Canada, where she has charted more than twenty-five singles, including the Number One hits \"Take It Like a Man\", \"One Time Around\", \"Guitar Talk\", \"One Good Man\", \"Nobody's Girl\" and \"Crank My Tractor\". She also had chart success in the United States in the early 1990s, landing in the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts with \"Take It Like a Man\" at #10 and \"He Would Be Sixteen\" at #31.\nMichelle Wright began recording her debut album, Do Right By Me in 1985. She released it in 1988 on Savannah Records. The same year, Reba McEntire recorded the title track and included it on her self-titled album, Reba, along with the songs \"I Wish I Were Only Lonely\" and \"New Fool At An Old Game.\" Reba's version of \"New Fool At An Old Game\" reached #1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. Michelle also recorded \"Rock Me Gently,\" originally written and recorded by Andy Kim in 1974, and included it on her debut album. Signed to Arista Records in 1990, Michelle had her first American country top 40 hit with \"New Kind of Love\" from her second album, Michelle Wright.She followed up with her most successful album, Now and Then, in 1992. The first single, \"Take It Like a Man,\" was her first Billboard top 10 hit and the video reached #1 on Country Music Television (CMT). She scored her second Billboard top 40 hit with the album's third single, \"He Would Be Sixteen.\"On the strength of \"Take It Like a Man,\" Wright went on to win the Academy of Country Music (ACM) Top New Female Vocalist in 1992, beating out fellow newcomers Martina McBride and Joy Lynn White. \"Safe In The Arms Of Love,\" a track from 1994's The Reasons Why, was later recorded by Martina in 1995.\"We've Tried Everything Else,\" a track found on both The Reasons Why and 1996's For Me It's You, was co-written by Pam Tillis and can be found on her 1992 album Homeward Looking Angel. Michelle guest-starred in a 1998 episode of Due South called \"Mountie Sings the Blues\". She appeared as Canadian country singer Tracy Jenkins and performed her songs \"Nobody's Girl\" (with Fraser as her back-up singer) and \"Every Time You Come Around\". In 1999, Michelle released her first ever Greatest Hits compilation, simply titled The Greatest Hits Collection. The album was later released to the United States in January, 2000. It featured twelve singles covering her career from 1990-1996, two new songs (\"When I Found You\" and \"I Surrender\"), her gospel version of \"People Get Ready,\" and \"Walkin' After Midnight,\" a track recorded for Patsy Cline's Duets album. The U.S. version, simply titled Greatest Hits, featured only 10 songs. In early 2000, her collaboration with pianist Jim Brickman (\"Your Love\") became her first top 20 Adult Contemporary (AC) hit. In 2002, Michelle released Shut Up and Kiss Me. The single \"I Surrender,\" originally recorded for her greatest hits, was also included on this album, but featured a more pop-oriented version of the song. In 2006, Michelle returned to the scene with her current country album, Everything and More. Six singles have been released from the album, \"Everything and More,\" \"Love Me Anyway,\" \"I've Forgotten You,\" \"Dance In The Boat,\" \"Riding Around The Sun\" and her most recent single \"I Don't Wanna Be That Strong.\" Also included on the album was \"My Give a Damn's Busted,\" a song originally recorded by Joe Diffie and Jo Dee Messina. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Michelle+Wright\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
