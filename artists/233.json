They changed their band's name upon signing with Wind-Up Records to avoid copyright issues; the name Atomship derives from their former name, as well as that book's author, Richard Adams. Their first album, The Crash of '47, so named after the famous Roswell incident, was released in 2004.\n\n   Commercial Success for the band didn't go too well however. They did on appear on the soundtrack for NASCAR Chase For The Cup (2005) with their song \"Pencil Fight\". But on December 5, 2009, singer Derek Pardoe announnced on the Facebook and Myspace pages that guitarist Nathan Slade had died due to an accidental overdose from prescription drugs. Thus came the band names AtomshipDown, and currently Watership Down.\n\n   On June 15, 2010 however, Derek made a Youtube post indicating that more music was on the way. Here's hoping they do come back. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Atomship\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
