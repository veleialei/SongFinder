After he recorded his Grammy Nominated album \"Soulscape,\" Rob moved to Los Angeles and was quickly drafted into the LA Jazz Scene playing on albums by The Rippingtons, Ronnie Laws, The Crusaders, Hubert Laws, Wilton Felder, and a host of other established artists. \nSoon thereafter, Rob went on to focus on his own music making albums with Brian Bromberg, Joel Taylor, Dave Carpenter and Ernie Watts in the late 80's.\n\nIn the 90's, Rob returned to the studio after touring with the Crusaders to record 'Music For Lovers\", \"One Night In Houston\" and began working on the \"Dance For The New World\" project-his tribute to the digital age and it's implications. \n\nMullins became very active as a touring keyboardist for Bruce Willis and Eric Marienthal while recording his own CD \"Joyful Noyz\" in 1999. Working during the day as a staff composer on several TV shows while touring and recording, Mullins composed two chart topping songs for Marienthal during this period, and he considers Marienthal one of the most talented and exemplary artists of this era.\n\nMullins made \"Winter Dreams\" a solo piano project in 1998.\n\nA club gig at Steamers Jazz Club in 2004 reunited Rob with jazz legend Terence Love who suggested a live album with the current version of the band in 2004-5 which included Jimmy Roberts (Rod Stewart) on sax as well as bassist David Levray and drummer Evan Stone. The result \"Standards & \nMore\" received acclaim as a top jazz record in 2006.\n\nRob's more recent releases include \"The Edge of Dreams\" (2010), \"We Remember 9/11 Nine Year Anniversary\" (2010), \"Galaxy 12\" (2011).\n\nAs the music industry crumbled in the beginning of the 21st Century, Rob Mullins fans began posting his hit songs on Youtube where there are now more than 40 of his songs available as well as some live footage of him performing.\n\nIn 2011 Rob is working on his 26th album and continues to perform world tours with Hubert Laws and his own groups.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rob+Mullins\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
