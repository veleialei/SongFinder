He is best remembered for his notorious live performances that typically featured wildly transgressive acts. Some of these acts included Allin defecating and urinating onstage, rolling in feces and often consuming excrement, committing self-injury, performing naked, taunting people to perform fellatio on him and committing violent actions toward the audience. Although more notorious for his stage antics than for his wide body of music, he recorded prolifically, not only in the punk rock genre, but also in spoken word, country and Rolling Stones-influenced rock. Though he had a devoted cult following, Allin's music has received mostly negative reviews from critics.\n\nhttp://www.ggallin.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/GG+Allin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
