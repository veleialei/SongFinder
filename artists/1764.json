It included a rendition of \"Always on My Mind.\"\n\nTwo more singles followed on the Primero label: \"We've Got to Start Meeting Like This\" and \"Just Once,\" followed by \"She Took It Too Well\" on 16th Avenue Records in 1984. The last label for which he recorded was Warner Bros. Records between 1987 and 1988. Although he reached Top 20 with \"Louisiana Rain\" during his stay on Warner, he did not release an album for the label.\n\nSince the release of his last single in 1988, Ryles has served primarily as a background vocalist and demo singer. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/John+Wesley+Ryles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
