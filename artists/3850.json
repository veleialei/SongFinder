The couple left Rocketown soon after, and began working on an independently produced CD 'Second Story', which they released in 2000.\n\nThe pair signed on Columbia Records in 2002 and Wilshire released 'New Universe'. The new album continued the couple's abandoning of the CCM genre, choosing instead to move more towards pop-rock. The album had a minor hit with the song 'Special'.\n\nWilshire released another independent EP, entitled 'Already Home', in 2005.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Wilshire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
