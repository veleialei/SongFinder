There’s nothing new about combining R & B, Rock and Roll, Country, Blues, Pop and Rock. The Rolling Stones and the Beatles proved that it can yield marvelous and diverse results. I said he wasn’t a PURIST. I didn’t say he wasn’t very PICKY about the quality of the music. That includes everything from the sonics of the recordings, the choice of players, the influences he draws on, the songs he chooses to cover, or how attentive he is to the craftsmanship of his own songs.\n\nThe self-proclaimed “Last Of The Full Grown Men\" hasn’t limited his creativity to the music business. There’s the picture business. His critically acclaimed indie films made him a cult hero and led to a major motion picture (Peter Bogdonavich’s “The Thing Called Love,” Paramount). He’s done guest appearances on other’s albums (Ben Folds, Jason Ringenberg, Farmer Jason, William Shatner, Maura O’Connell), and a Disney produced duo of companion CD’s for the animated movie “Cars.” His smooth baritone has been used for voice-overs on countless radio commercials; he even did a stint as one of America’s FIRST Satellite DJs on XM Radio for four and a half years. Using all manner of media, Webb Wilder has been impacting Popular culture (and it him) for way over 20 years, all the while maintaining a devoted worldwide fan base through a relentless, never ending tour schedule.\n\nMore Like Me, his first collection of new material since 2005, is classic Webb - an exciting blend of bedrock American music and bittersweet ballads incorporating a host of influences. Not forgotten is his ever present irreverent attitude and wit. According to Gibson Guitar magazine, this “gives Wilder's music a sense of fun and imagination often lacking among his peers.”\n\nA native of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Wilder moved to Austin, Texas in 1976 with his boyhood friend, Bobby “Crow” Field. Incorporating a British Invasion influence (among others) into their then double time tunes separated Wilder’s music from the pack. After moving to Nashville, Wilder and Field formed the Beatnecks in 1985. As Nashville moved toward unapologetically commercial fare, Wilder and Field were busy crafting their signature brand of rock 'n' roll, founded on classic influences from both sides of the pond. Wilder's debut, It Came From Nashville, a brazenly rocking bar-band rave-up, seems even more unlikely now than it must have seemed then. His subsequent albums (Hybrid Vigor, Doo Dad, Town & Country, Acres of Suede, About Time and Born To Be Wilder (live)), have continually maintained the high standard set by the first, becoming textbooks for aspiring roots rockers and showing there was (and is) a vibrant market for their hybrid brand of Southern musical gumbo.\n\nIn concert, Wilder spikes the punch between songs with potent doses of rustic wit and character, transcendent mediations, incantations, and codes by which to live. Webb’s first Blind Pig release, Born To Be Wilder captured that on-stage alchemy with a set featuring favorites such as “The Human Cannonball,” “Tough It Out”, “Miss Missy From Ol’ Hong Kong”, “Louisiana Hannah,” and others, at their rockin’ best in front of a sold out enthusiastic crowd. Elmore Magazine called Born To Be Wilder “a generous helping of fresh, tasty rock 'n' roll that will leave the listener asking for seconds,\" while American Songwriter said it “highlights the musical attributes that make him appealing and unique.\"\n\nMusic critics have always warmed up to the Webb Wilder juggernaut. The Associated Press described the band's music and stage performance as \"a glorious amalgamation of grunge chords, killer grooves, Screamin' Jay Hawkins theatrics, a healthy sense of humor, and great pop melodies.\" It's \"full of wit and personality, and devoid of technological or conceptual gimmickry,\" added the Houston Post.\n\nThe early films (Webb Wilder, Pvt. Eye: The Saucer’s Reign, Horror Hayride) have become underground cult classics. They were recently compiled on the Webb Wilder's Amazing B Picture Shorts DVD released in 2008. The DVD also features some WW related bonus material as well as some fine (non-Webb) films from acclaimed Webb Wilder cinematographer, Steve Mims.\n\nWebb Wilder is an evangelist for real Rock 'n' Roll. As a singer, guitarist, bandleader, film actor, songwriter and humorist, he may be roots-rock's only true Renaissance man. \n\n\"Work hard, rock hard, sleep hard, eat hard, grow big, wear glasses if you need 'em.\"\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Webb+Wilder\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
