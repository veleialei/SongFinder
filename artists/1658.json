Stemming from a progressive-rock background, he works within a contemporary artistic-Christian framework, and precedes much of the New Age music to which much of his music would later be compared. He has made collaborations with various other well-known musicians, including, Sandy Simpson, and Brian Dunning. His works include collaborations with contemporary author Stephen Lawhead.\n\nIn addition to recording, Johnson is active in the on-going Selah Service music and worship events.\n\neff Johnson's first studio efforts, The Anvil Of God's Word and Please Forgive Us Lord were recorded in 1976. These were never officially released on CD. After many years, they were made available on a CD entitled Early Songs as part of the ArkMusic Special Editions series. [1]\n\nJeff Johnson's first studio album, Face of the Deep (1980) managed to conjour aural landscapes in the ears of his listeners with his synthesizer infused progressive rock renditions of fantasy works. The album begins with the pensive image of Rodin's The Thinker. Songs are inspired by writings such as Charles Williams' All Hallows' Eve, and by the paintings of Gauguin and Renoir's The Moulin de la Galette. Johnson completes his treatment of these aural landscapes with on-location recordings of atmospheric sounds such as rain storms and creaking gates - incorporating them into the music in an artful way (see: History - 'Ark Mobile').\n\nOn his second album, he collaborated with Sandy Simpson to record Through the Door (1982), which further took up theme of a spiritual questing inspired by the novels of George MacDonald (The Golden Key). It also continued the use of synthesizers in the slightly sci-fi themed song, The Jupiter Effect. It was also on this album that Johnson first recorded his personal 'theme' - 'Someday someday' -- a song he would record in several versions throughout his discography.\n\nJohnson continued the theme of the spiritual quest on albums such as: Fallen Splendour and Pilgrimage. Incorporating influences from several of the Inklings, including a song inspired by C.S. Lewis -- Dream of the Island (Similitudes).\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Jeff Johnson's work is his commitment to excellence in the various details of record production. From the beautiful cover artwork drawn by Kathy Hastings, to the immaculate limited-edition packaging for his master-piece, Icons.\n\nJohnson is a versatile musician, using sounds which range from progressive rock with soaring synthesizers to acoustic Oregon double-bass and contemporary piano solos. Johnson has collaborated in a number of distinct projects over the course of his discography. The genres include: Instrumental Fantasy, Vocal, Celtic and Sci-fi inspired works.\n\nMore recently (2002), he can be heard with Brian Dunning on the Gangs of New York (soundtrack), where he plays alongside artists such as Peter Gabriel.\n\nJeff Johnson is also the founder of Ark Records - which he founded in Tigard, Oregon.\n\nAround 1998, he moved Ark Records to its new home on Camano Island, WA.\n\nArk Records publishes both Jeff Johnson's significant catalogue of albums, and also those of various musical associates. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Johnson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
