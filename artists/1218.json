The band reached stardom during the early 1990s with hit singles like \"Don't Treat Me Bad\" and \"All She Wrote\", as well as their signature ballads \"I Live My Life for You\", \"Love of a Lifetime\", and \"When I Look Into Your Eyes\". At the 1992 American Music Awards, FireHouse won the award for Favorite Heavy Metal/Hard Rock New Artist; chosen over Nirvana and Alice in Chains.\n\nDespite diminishing success in the United States as the decade progressed, the band remained very popular in Asia, mainly in countries like Japan, Thailand, and Singapore. FireHouse continued to release new material throughout the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, most of which has successfully charted in Japan. The band has also continued to tour internationally as of 2007, having participated twice in the annual Rock Never Stops Tour with other bands of the 1980s. FireHouse is estimated to have sold over 6 million albums worldwide since their debut.\n\nIn December 2004, FireHouse became the first major international rock band to play concert dates in northeast India.[7] The band's first Indian concert date was in Shillong, followed by two more dates in Dimapur, and Aizawl.[7] The band's first Indian date, in Shillong When the Maharaja of Tripura Kirit Pradyot Deb Burman invited them, took place in front of a sold out stadium crowd of over 40,000, setting a record for that city.[5] The band toured in 2005, 2006, and launched another tour in 2007 visiting states in the Midwest United States such as North Dakota and playing at several festivals including Rocklahoma.[8] In a March 2007 interview, when asked about the band's next album, guitarist Bill Leverty said \"we plan on going into the studio this coming winter. Hopefully, we’ll be able to get all the songs together and record them for a spring/summer release.\"[2] Regarding the future of the band, C.J. Snare commented that \"this has been an incredible, incredible career. To do something that you love, to be an artist, to be an entertainer and to actually go out there and have fans all over the world and be able to make a living at it. As long as that's perpetuated, I don’t see any reason to ever stop.\"[5]\n\n\nBand members\n\nOriginally composed of vocalist C.J. Snare, guitarist Bill Leverty, drummer Michael Foster, and bassist Perry Richardson, the band has maintained all of its original members with the exception of Richardson, who departed in 2000 due to conflict. Richardson was initially replaced by Bruce Waibel, but Waibel left in 2003 to spend more time with his family. Dario Seixas was brought on board to play bass on the band's 2003 album Prime Time, but he parted ways with the band shortly after the album was released. Current bassist Allen McKenzie was given the position in 2004.[3]\n\nGuitarist Bill Leverty and C.J. Snare have both pursued solo careers, but neither have let their solo projects interfere with the band's studio and touring efforts. Leverty has released two solo albums; Wanderlust in 2004 and Southern Exposure in 2007, and when asked if he would ever tour in support of them, he said that it would be \"extremely selfish\" to do so while putting the band on hold.[9] Snare has commented in several interviews that he is working on a solo album, but such an album has yet to materialize.[5] Drummer Michael Foster has participated in Leverty's solo career by playing drums on both of his albums.\n\n\nCurrent\n\nC.J.
