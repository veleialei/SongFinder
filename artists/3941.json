The band is fronted by Stephen Butler and Brian Butler.\n\n\nThe Butler brothers originally led a new wave power pop band called Quincy. The band recorded an LP for Columbia in 1980 and began to tour, but their momentum was curtailed when producer/performer Quincy Jones saw the name \"Quincy\" on the marquee at the Whiskey in Los Angeles. He sent the band a \"cease-and-desist\" order. Quincy was no longer allowed to use the name, and broke up soon afterward. Quincy did record one more EP for Columbia records but under the new name \" Lu Lu Temple\". Stephen and Brian Butler were becoming unhappy with the direction the band was taking and quit while the record was being recorded. The Lulu Temple EP was released in 1983.\n\nThe Butler brothers quickly formed a new band \"Smash Palace \" and signed with Epic Records in 1985. The new line included Stephen Butler, lead guitar and vocals, Brian Butler, lead vocals, Phil Barnett (aka Rizzo) bass guitar, Harry Lewis, drums and Greg Persun, rhythm guitar. The bands first LP came out in the fall of 1985 with an MTV video of their first single \" Living on the Borderline\" which was directed by Nigel Dick. The band toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada with Mr. Mister, and the Cruzados. When their A&R man, Dick Wingate left for Polygram Records in 1985 he asked Smash Palace to come on over to his new label. Unfortunately, once the band left Epic, the offer from Polygram melted away. Disillusioned and broke, Stephen and Brian Butler took staff song writer jobs at CBS Songs, EMI, and then with BMG. Not finding much happiness or success in the hit songwriting business, the Butlers left the music business for a while. Stephen Butler was the first to return working as a co writer and guitarist with \"Mary Lee's Corvette\" in 1997. This has been a relationship he has maintained for the past 10 years and he has produced the the most recent Mary Lee Cd \" Love Loss and Lunacy\" which was released in 2006. In 1999, the Butler brothers reunited to release the follow up recording to their 1985 LP with a 14 year wait in between. The new Cd was recorded by just the Butler brothers themselves at Stephens house using some recording equipment he has just purchased. Once the songs were completed, they signed with the indie label \"Imagine Records\". The first single \"Another Man\" was a top 100 rock radio track the summer of 99. The band played out live with a new line up. Stephen Butler, lead vocals and lead guitar, Brian Butler, drums and vocals, DyAnne DiSalvo, rhythm guitar and vocals, Phil Rizzo, Bass guitar and Greg DiDonato on keyboards. Anthony Bezich has been drumming for the band since 2004 with the retirement from live performing by Brian Butler. Brian is still active in the writing and recording aspects but spends his time these days pursing his other passions, art and photography. In 2001 the next Smash Palace CD was released entitled \"Unlocked\" followed by 2004's \" Over The Top. \" Best Of 99-06\" came out in 2006 on Zip Records. The band has been touring the eastern coast of the United States and also the United Kingdom. Their newest album, \" Everybody Comes and Goes\" was released in January, 2008. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Smash+Palace\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
