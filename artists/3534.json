She wrote her first song at 8 years old alongside a creek bank in Kentucky and went on to write and sing some 2,500 songs during a career that spanned six decades and over 70 albums!.  She listened to the Grand Ole Opry and performed on a radio show when just a young girl.  Forced to leave home at age 12 because of an abusive father, she went on the road and never returned home.  But she did become reconciled to her father later in life.  A very close friend of Elvis Presley, Elvis had contracted with her to record 12 of her songs, but only had got one finished at the time of his death.  Other artists who have recorded her songs are too numerous to mention, but include Whitney Houston (Preacher's Wife Soundtrack), Barbra Mandrell, Dolly Parton, Jerry Lee Lewis and Pat Boone.  In 1968, Dottie Rambo received a Trendsetter Award from Billboard Magazine and a Grammy, being one of the first white artists to record with black singers.  For this project, the KKK even threatened her life.  Other awards included a lifetime achievement award from ASCAP and Songwriter of the Century Award from the Christian Country Music Association.  In Christian music, there was possibly no one with greater influence than Dottie Rambo, music-wise, with her music crossing over and influencing many genres.  Tragically, she was killed on her tour bus on Mother's Day 2008.  At the time of this writing in 2013, her former manager, Larry Ferguson, is slated to come out with a tribute project to Dottie Rambo featuring some 30 artists, such as Little Richard, Dolly Parton, Ricky Skaggs, David Phelps, Dottie Peoples and many others. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rambos\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
