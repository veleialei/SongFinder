With the addition of pianist Tim Sievert, the quartet started singing under the name Ron Booth and the Booth Brothers. A few years later, Sievert left the band due to increasing hand problems, but they continued as a trio. They self-released Beyond the Cross with help from arranger/composer Mosie Lister. In 1993, their first popularity surged after an appearance at the Grand Ole Gospel Reunion and they again shortened their name to the Booth Brothers. They released their first Morning Star recording, Praise God Any How, in 1995 and after Ron Booth Sr. retired, he was replaced by former Perfect Heart member Joesph Smith. The lineup of Smith, Ronnie Booth Jr., and Michael Booth still exists. The group was awarded the SGMA Artist of the Year in 1999. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Booth+Brothers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
