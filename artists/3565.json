After relocating from Sydney to Melbourne , 2 Litre Dolby gained a strong following through their three releases (including a UK release) and renowned live shows.\n\nWhilst still in 2 Litre Dolby, Leo made guest appearances on recordings by international visitors Evan Dando and Archer Prewitt (The Sea & Cake) playing bass. In the meantime, Phil and friends formed Melbourne band, Radius.\n\nAfter 2 Litre Dolby parted ways in mid 2000, Leo and Phil formed The Friendly Injun using a more minimal ethic towards song writing. Combiming acoustic guitars, fan powered organ and strong harmonies, The Friendly Injun brought new life to some well-worn traditions. The Friendly Injun would later change their name to The Small Knives.\n\nIn their live history, The Small Knives have shared stages with Evan Dando, Art of Fighting, Preston School of Industry, Mark Eitzel, Machine Translations, New Buffalo, Songs:Ohia, Gersey and Architecture in Helsinki . They were also part of the 2002 Harvest Festival, played on the Gene Clark tribute album You Can't Hide Your Love Forever And played at the Gram Parsons tribute night held at The Corner hotel.\n\nThe Small Knives started recording their debut album \"Rain on Tin\" in October 2002. They spent a week in Blairgowrie at a friends beach house. Marcus engineered the album and using some top quality, analogue equipment for the recording. What was initially intended to be a relaxed week of recording turned out to be an intense week or lengthy days and nights.\n\nOn their return to Melbourne they discovered that some of the takes weren't performed exactly as they had hoped. At this stage they were out of money and the following 12 months were spent raising funds and trying to fit in days to right the wrongs. Marty Brown from Art of Fighting kindly offered his drumming services in late 2003 and contributed some great drum tracks which revitalised the bands enthusiasm for the album. Barry Turnbull then added some pedal steel to the album and Trent Walter played viola. Finally by January 2004 it was mixed, mastered and ready to go. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Small+Knives\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
