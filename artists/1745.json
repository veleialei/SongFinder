As a young boy, Frizzell sang soprano in the National Cathedral Choir, the Paris Opera Company, and the Metropolitan Opera Company. However, once he hit puberty, his voice changed. He continued his study of music at the University of Southern California and the Manhattan School of Music, but he began to focus more on the jazz guitar than voice. After he finished college, Frizzell worked with Michael Mainieri, a famous producer and became exposed to synthesis and helped Mainieri on many commercials, movies, and records.\n\nFrizzell's career excelled and he worked with many more renowned composers, directors and producers including Ryuichi Sakamoto, John Sacret Young, James Newton Howard, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Joel Silver, Randy Edelman and Mark Rydell.
