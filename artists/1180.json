With his signature “floor destroyer” style, there’s never a shortage of bass weight when FSTZ is on the decks. His mixing skills have received worldwide attention; most notably from dubstep godfather Joe Nice, who had this to say…\n\n“FSTZ was in the zone at the Czar Bar. No doubt about it. I remember the night vividly – Thanksgiving weekend, cold outside and there was a buzz in the air about the Mizzou football game at the club. FTSZ was powermixing on all levels. One of the best performances I’ve seen all year from a DJ.”/ – Joe Nice, Gourmet Beats\n\nIn 2009, 2010 and 2011 FSTZ was nominated “Best Dance DJ” by the Pitch Weekly, Kansas City’s arts and culture magazine. More than just a DJ, FSTZ has been producing music for over a decade, as well as running 2 Digital labels, RogueDubs and Snatchy Trax and a vinyl record label, Rogue Plates. He has released his music on W.E. Recordings, Spec Ops, Bassism Records, Phantom Hertz and  Dubfront Records. You can catch FSTZ nearly every Saturday on Dubstep.fm or on a sound system near you.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/FSTZ\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
