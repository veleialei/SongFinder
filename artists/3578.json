Their first full-length album, In Combo, was released in 1980, featuring tense, energetic playing and offbeat lyrics. The 1981 double album Credit in Heaven consolidated the band's approach, incorporating elements of disco and blue-eyed soul. The 12\" single \"Waiting\" got the band substantial play in dance clubs and attracted the attention of Mercury, which signed them in 1983 and re-released their Dream Hog EP. Their major-label debut, Love Is the Law, was a harder-rocking effort which emphasized Chaney and Poling's novel lyrics and featured a horn section. 1986 found the band on A&M working with producer Robert Brent, who played drums in Prince's Revolution under the name Bobby Z; the resulting self-titled album strikes a balance between their traditional sound and, unsurprisingly, that of the Revolution. The band broke up in 1987; Twin/Tone released a best-of collection, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Suburbs Have Left the Building, in 1992. Poling  contributed piano work to the Replacements' 1984 masterpiece Let It Be.\n\n2 - Suburbs, a Dutch rock band from Scheveningen. They recorded 3 albums (Disturbed, New Buildings and Land of the Lunatics) and 5 singles (Doremi, Timemachine, Rollercoaster, Citylights and What's going on). For more information visit www.suburbs.nl (dutch). They run under the label of Red Bullet. Suburbs perform often in Scheveningen, The Hague (a city near Scheveningen)or Wateringen  (a village near The Hague).\n\n3 -Suburbs: A canadian punk-rock band who run under the label Slam Disque. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Suburbs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
