The writing duo of Su and Dave Wainwright has created material that has graced television, radio, video, 3 albums, 2 EP's and over 20 compilations. The soaring and powerful voice of Su Wainwright (formerly Farr); driving tribal drumming of her husband Dave, crashing guitar work of Chris Hines and complex, percussive bass work of Rob Quick has forged one of the most unique and distinctive unsigned bands in the UK.\n \nTheir albums have been heralded as \"gothic masterpieces\" and the last album, Sigil, had praise heaped upon it by some of the scenes most respected reviewers and was voted the \"Number 1\" album of 2003 by one of the UK's leading northern clubs, Carpe Noctum. The album caused so much of a stir that the band were interviewed in an half hour long program that featured 2 of the songs from Sigil, for ITV in the UK and tracks were snapped up for 7 compilations by record labels including Nightbreed/PPD and Strobelight Records. In 2006 the album sold out and was moved to digital download on iTunes/Napster/Rhapsody and a string of leading online stores.\n \n‘Carnival Noir’, the 2005 follow up EP, pushed their list of successes further (causing the band to be signed to an independent label Chromium E3 for a short while, before the label went bust). The demise of the label didn’t stop the band and they pressed on with making the critically acclaimed video for Carnival Noir.\n \nThe stage show has graced several of the UK’s leading alternative venues (including Nottingham Rock City, Cardiff Millennium Stadium, JB’s in Dudley, Bristol Bierkeller and the famous Whitby Gothic Weekend) as well as Germany's Gothic Pogo Party in Leipzig and has been described as 'powerful' and 'theatrical'.  The music has been described by Mick Mercer of NME fame as having 'raw, whooshing old school power'.  Rich keyboard and synthesizer elements complete the Cauda Pavonis sound making the music markedly different and pushing the band beyond many of their contemporaries.\n \n2008 is the tenth anniversary of the band and is set to be a great year for Cauda Pavonis as they look to release their 4th studio album which will be backed by a UK and mainland European Tour.\n\n\nDISCOGRAPHY\n1999 - Initiation\n2000 - Pistols at Dawn\n2001 - Controversial Alchemy\n2003 - Sigil\n2005 - Carnival Noir\n2008 - Wars & Masquerades\n2012 - Peace Through Superior Firepower\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/caudapavonis\nwww.caudapavonis.com\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cauda+Pavonis\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
