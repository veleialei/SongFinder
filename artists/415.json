The Chills Songfacts states that the the first single, \"The Chills,\" was made available for digital download on May 31, 2011 and sent to radio on June 27, 2011.\n\nBlue October signed to Universal Records with the release of Consent To Treatment in 2000. After sales did not meet expectations, Universal dropped them from their label. In 2003 Blue October released History for Sale on Dallas-based Brando Records, and was later resigned by Universal Records due to the album's success and the band's growing fanbase due to nonstop touring.\n\nThe band's next album, Foiled, was released in 2006 and quickly became the band's long awaited breakthrough thanks to the success of songs such as \"Hate Me\" and \"Into the Ocean\" on American pop and alternative radio and VH-1.\n\nApproaching Normal was released on 24 March 2009. It contains the Top 10 modern rock hit \"Dirt Room\".\n\nPrevious band members have included Liz Mullally, Brant Coulter, Dwayne Casey, Piper Skih and CB Hudson.\n\nBlue October has an official site www.blueoctoberfan.com.\n\nFor the British band, please see Blue October UK <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Blue+October\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
