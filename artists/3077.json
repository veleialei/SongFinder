The group released its self-titled debut album in 1994 through its independent record label, Croakin' Poets and shortly after its release, singer/guitarist Ryan Newell and drummer Mark Trojanowski joined the band. Newell played on the album before officially joining the group.\n\nThe band's second album, ...Somewhere More Familiar was released in 1997 and sold approximately 30,000 copies through its initial pressing, prompting Universal Records to sign the band. Universal re-released ...Somewhere More Familiar in late 1997. A single from the album, \"All For You\" hit #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and remains the band's most successful single.\n\nThe band's third album Fortress was released in 2000 by Universal. The band worked with producers Mike Clink (Guns N' Roses, Mötley Crüe, Heart), Richie Zito (Cheap Trick), and Paul Ebersold (3 Doors Down). The album featured minor pop hits \"Champagne High\" and \"Change Your Mind.\"\n\nIn 2003, after the band split from Universal, it released its fourth studio album, Chasing Daylight, on the Sixthman label and toured throughout the year to promote the album. The band's internet presence emerged during this time period, and hardcore fans dubbing themselves \"Hazelnuts\" studied setlists, shared bootleg concert recordings, and initiated a promotion scheme with the band through their official website. 2003 also saw the simultaneous release of Live*LIVE, a two-disc live album, and A Life in the Day, a live DVD.\n\nIn 2004, Sister Hazel released its next studio album Lift. Songs from Lift were re-recorded for 2005's Lift: Acoustic Renditions, an EP of studio acoustic takes on five of the songs, offered exclusively through Apple's iTunes Store. In July 2005, the Sister Hazel album was re-issued again by Sixthman, in response to claims that the album had become difficult to find in stores.\n\nSister Hazel then promoted its album, Absolutely, which was released on October 10, 2006. The band also continued to tour and hold annual fan gathering events, The Rock Boat and The Rock Slope. Absolutely is the band's highest charting album on the Billboard charts following Fortress and it received 4 out of a possible 5 stars from Allmusic, a tie with Fortress's score.\n\nOn June 5, 2007, Sister Hazel released a \"hybrid\" album entitled BAM! Volume 1. It contains B-sides from the Absolutely recording sessions and some from previous albums.\n\nSister Hazel also released a holiday album called Santa's Playlist on September 25, 2007.\n\nOn February 9, 2008, Sister Hazel performed a live concert at Daytona International Speedway for the Budweiser Shootout.\n\nSister Hazel released a live acoustic album on June 17, 2008 entitled Before The Amplifiers, Live Acoustic on Croakin' Poets/Rock Ridge Music. The record features sixteen tracks, including the band's hits, fan favorites, and live concert staples, all in a stripped-down, acoustic format. The album was recorded on January 12 at Nickel & Dime Studios in Atlanta (other bands who have recorded there in the past include Indigo Girls, The B-52's, Shawn Mullins) in front of 100 lucky fans who were chosen at random from more than five thousand entries.\n\nAt the July 18, 2008 concert at Wolf Trap Farm Park, drummer Mark Trojanowski took paternity leave for his newborn child. Former Vertical Horizon and current Doobie Brothers drummer Ed Toth played in his place.\n\nOn July 9, 2009 Ford Motor Company announced a collaboration with Sister Hazel to promote the company's new Sync Technology, which is available on a number of Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles. The band has been chosen to be the face of the company's \"Sync My Ride\" website.\n\nThe band released its seventh studio album of original songs (tenth album overall) on August 18, 2009. The album, entitled \"Release\", contains 12 tracks and is on the Rock Ridge Music label. On the day of release, \"Release\" was the number one album on iTunes. \n\nOn October 12th, 2010, Sister Hazel released their 8th studio album, \"Heartland Highway\", which is unique among SH albums in that all band members wrote at least one song that appears on the album. \n\n\nSister Hazel Williams was an African-American woman who ran Sister Hazel's Rescue Mission in Gainesville, FL. during the 1970s and early '80s. This facility gave those who were down on their luck a safe place to stay warm, eat and regroup, regardless of age, race or beliefs. It is in this spirit of unconditional concern for all beings that the band chose to use her name.\n\n\nThe band has had music featured in several movies and soundtracks including Major League: Back to the Minors, The Wedding Planner, Clay Pigeons, Bedazzled, American Wedding, and 10 Things I Hate About You. Sister Hazel also appear on the Fleetwood Mac tribute album, Legacy: A Tribute to Fleetwood Mac's Rumours with their cover version of \"Gold Dust Woman\". In 1999, they recorded a cover of \"September Gurls\" for the Big Star tribute album, Big Star, Small World. However, the track was not included when the album was released in 2006. The song \"Where Do You Go\" was featured on Scrubs (Season 6, Episode 4, \"My House\").\n\n\nBand members\nKen Block - lead vocals, acoustic guitar\nJett Beres - bass, harmony vocals\nAndrew Copeland - rhythm guitar, vocals\nRyan Newell - lead and slide guitar, harmony vocals\nMark Trojanowski - drums <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sister+Hazel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
