This album was followed one year later by Living in a Moment, which produced his second Number One country hit in its title track.\n\nThree more albums for Epic followed — Big Hopes , Steam, and This Is Ty Herndon: Greatest Hits — although none matched the success of his debut. He recorded a Christmas album in 2002 for the Riviera label, followed by his fifth studio album (2007's Right About Now) and a second Christmas compilation for the Titan Pyramid label.\n\nOverall, Herndon has charted a total of seventeen singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. This figure includes three Number ones — \"What Mattered Most\" (1995) \"Living in a Moment\" (1996), and \"It Must Be Love\" (1998) — as well as four additional Top Ten hits.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ty+Herndon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
