Following the EP's release on Rock Vegas Records, they quickly started doing multiple tours up and down the East coast and into the midwest. Following the line-up changes that most new bands undergo, the band's lineup recently settled with singer Tank, guitarists Joe Freedman and Dan Mancini, bassist Conor O' Brien and recently acquired new drummer, Justin Flaherty. The band has shared the stage and shows with everyone from Death Before Dishonor, Strike Anywhere, Modern Life Is War, Agnostic Front, Ignite, Comeback Kid, Crime In Stereo, Converge, Set Your Goals, to just about everyone in between. \n\nOwner Chris Wrenn said, \"One thing at Bridge Nine is that we always listen to our bands, both past and present, about people to keep an eye on. Two years ago, we got a phone call from Aram [the man of Champion, Betrayed, and Armenian descent] saying 'there's this band you need to keep an eye on called Energy-they're from Boston, so you have no excuse.' After that call, it seemed I was always watching Energy open for one of our bands and they kept getting better and better to where we needed to bring them into the fold. They add something different to the Boston area scene, and we're stoked to have them in the mix.\" \n\nENERGY draws from a wide range of musical influence from Hardcore Punk bands like The Misfits, Rancid, AFI, 7 Seconds, Minor Threat and Black Flag, to other influences such as Weezer, The Smashing Pumpkins, The Beach Boys and The Cure.\n\nEnergy enters Q Division studios in two weeks to record their debut full-length album to be released this fall, as well as an EP this summer. Until new material hits, you can check out some demos they posted last year at www.myspace.com/thisenergy\n\n2) ENERGY were a Northamptonshire-based British heavy metal band who released five 7\" singles between 1980 and 1986.\n\n3) Energy is a Taiwanese hip-hop/pop boy band formed in 2002.\n\n4) ENERGY was an American rock/fusion band from Boulder, Colorado. They formed in 1971 and split in 1973. The band included skilled musicians who would later go on to greater success.\n\nThe members in the most well-known lineup were:\n\nTommy Bolin: guitar (later played with Billy Cobham, James Gang and Deep Purple)\nJeff Cook: vocals, harmonica\nTom Stephenson: keyboards, vocals (left to join Joe Walsh)\nStanley Sheldon: bass (later played with Peter Frampton, Tommy Bolin and Warren Zevon et al.)\nBobby Berge: drums\n\nOther players included:\n\nKenny Passarelli: first bassist (quickly left to join Joe Walsh)\nJeremy Steig: flute\nGary Wilson: first vocalist (replaced by Jeff Cook)\nMax Gronenthal: keyboards, vocals (replaced Jeff Cook and Tom Stephenson) (session player. Member of .38 Special, Grand Funk Railroad)\nRussell Bizzett: drums (after Bobby left, then second drummer after Bobby returned) (Eric Johnson et al.)\n\nEnergy didn’t produce any official albums or singles until the Tommy Bolin Archives releases began appearing in the 1990’s. The first lineup of the band featuring Steig concentrated on long intense jams, often featuring Steig’s flute more than Tommy’s guitar. The band’s appeal was notably widened after adding a vocalist, beginning with Gary, then Jeff and later Max. The greatest amount of existing live material features Jeff Cook, and shows the band ranging from slow blues to rocking blues to hard rock to marathon fusion jams, often in one performance. Their studio output showed a band that would have made the big time if they had the power of a record deal. Some of the material written by Tommy with John Tesar and Jeff Cook went on to be used by Tommy in later bands. “Got No Time for Trouble” and “Praylude/Red Skies” were used in James Gang, “Lady Luck” with Deep Purple and “Dreamer” was used on his solo album Teaser. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Energy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
