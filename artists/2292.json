His grandmother gave him his first musical experience at a young age, bringing him to church to sing. He also cites the music of Bounty Killer as an early influence.\n\nThe boyhood idol became his mentor when at the age of 15, Bounty took him under his wing to show him the ropes of the music industry. He decided to name himself \"Mavado\" after the Swiss watch company Movado, altering the spelling.\n\nHis debut single, \"Real McKoy\" on the Anger Management riddim  in 2004, provided him instant success.He further established himself with the follow-up record “Weh Dem a Do”, on the Red Bull & Guinness riddim.

While in police custody, the singer claims he was thrown into a glass window, losing three fingers in the process, which were reattached at a local hospital. Police claimed Mavado escaped from custody while at the hospital. The incident caused him to be refused entry into the United States a short time later. He was again arrested and charged with shooting with intent and illegal possession of firearm in relation to an event occurring July 27, 2007. He was later freed of all charges. \n\nIn March 2008, Mavado was featured performing a rendition of his song \"Real McKoy\" for Grand Theft Auto IV] Trailer #4 \"Everyone's a Rat\". \"Real McKoy\", along with \"Last Night\" (both from the album ''Gangsta for Life''), were also featured in the game on the radio station \"Massive B Radio\".\n\nIn November 2009, Mavado lost out to Sean Paul for the Best Reggae Artist award at Soul Train Music Awards.
