Two other sizeable hits followed. In 1978 the band released \"Airport\" - which proved to be the band's biggest seller - and which peaked at number 4. The song was also a minor hit in the United States. The follow-up - the Motown-influenced \"Forget About You\" - was released two months later.\n\nThe Motors' original recording line-up released two albums, both of which met with modest success; The Motors 1 in 1977 and Approved By the Motors the following year. After that record, the Motors split up; Garvey and McMaster used the band's name for the 1980 album Tenement Steps, which didn't equal the spark of their first two records. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Motors\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
