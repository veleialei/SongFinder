Formed in 2005 by former Gun member Dante Gizzi, their style is that of rocky, funky, light-hearted pop; insofar as they have been dubbed the Scottish Scissor Sisters. The band have supported Oasis and Duran Duran on major tours of the UK. The band also gained major exposure with slots at T in the Park 2005, V Festival and Glastonbury 2005. Sadly, their stage flooded after extreme rain falls at Glastonbury 2005, which lead to them and other bands being cancelled, but they have been promised a major slot in 2007. Their self-titled debut album was released in late 2005. \n\nMembers\nDante Gizzi (Vocals/occasional Guitar) \nJohnny McGlynn (Guitar) \nThomas McNeice (Bass) \nLaura Marks (Keyboards/Vocals) \nDawn Zhu (Drums) \nPrevious line up included Dante's brother Joolz Gizzi (formerly GUN and now playing with Blind allez) on Guitar.\n\nUnfortunately, the band have now split and been put on hold as Dante is now back together with brother Jools to reform Scottish rock giants GUN.\nThey have been joined by former Little Angels frontman Toby Jepson and, until recently, original drummer Al thornton.\n\nThe band have played a number of gigs in 2008, not least, Main Stage at T In The Park 2008.\nThey plan to celebrate 2009, the 20th anniversary of the release of their first album Taking On The World, with many more gigs and have released a mini album called Popkiller.\n\nCheck their official websites to find out more.\n\nwww.gunofficial.co.uk\n\nwww.myspace.com/gunpage\n\nwww.officialgunfans.co.uk\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/El+Presidente\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
