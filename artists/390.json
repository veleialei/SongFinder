Formed in 1993, this Cleveland-based crew first caught the ear of N.W.A. member Eazy-E.\n\nTheir trademark double and triple-time sung/rapped harmonies brought something new to the table at a time when most acts were busy trying to imitate what was featured on Dr. Dre's The Chronic. The unique sound prompted multi-platinum record sales, won them a Grammy, and brought the spotlight to the long-neglected Midwestern hip-hop community.\n\nAs a solo performer, Bizzy Bone is well known for his high-speed rhyme style and unique singing abilities. Continually writing and recording around the clock, he released his first solo album in 1998, the personal and introspective Heaven'z Movie. After receiving critical acclaim, Bizzy went on to write and release The Gift in 2001, Alpha and Omega in 2004, and The Beginning and the End, also in 2004, For The Fans vol. 1 and vol. 2 in 2005, The Story, Thugs Revenge, The Midwest Cowboy, and From Your Righteousness in 2006. His latest album Ruthless was released on March 4th 2008.\n\nBizzy's work has been awarded by numerous respected groups, including an ASCAP Award, the Michael Jackson Soul Train Award, a Blockbuster Award, an American Music Award, and the NAACP - Back To School/Stay in School Youth Rally Award. He has become a member of Hip Hop's elite, collaborating with modern hip-hop legends such as P Diddy, Snoop Dogg, as well as the late Eazy-E, 2Pac, and The Notorious B.I.G.. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bizzy+Bone\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
