Having spent some time in the well-known Tché Tché dance company, Dobet decided with Colin (in 1999) to form a duo, Ano Neko, which means “Let’s create together“ in Bété language. The duo toured widely in France (1999-2000) where they settled temporarily. They also worked together on the creation with Ba Cissoko of “Le Cabaret Nomade“ and “L’Entre Deux Monde“.\n\nWhen they returned to Abidjan in 2001, they took part in the MASA Off festival and, while they were there, recorded eight songs under the supervision of the late Marcellin Yacé. \n\nIn 2003, their artistic project refocused on Dobet Gnahoré and expanded when a backup vocalist and a percussionist joined them.  They produced her first album entitled “Ano Neko“. This CD comprises songs recorded in Abidjan and others recorded in Belgium during the summer of 2003.\n\nFrom Mandingue melodies to Congolese rumba, from Ivory Coast Ziglibiti to Cameroon Bikoutsi, from Ghanian High-Life to Zulu choirs, their compositions, carried along with jazz-like sounds, are varied and colourful. The sanza, the balafon, the calebasse and bongos are brought in to support the guitar, the vocal backup and Dobet’s warm and powerful voice...\n\nDobet sings in a range of African languages including Bété, Fon, Baoule, Lingala, Malinke, Mina or Bambara, thereby reproducing the Pan-African tradition of the Ki Yi Mbock group. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Dobet+Gnahor%C3%A9\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
