In years past, the crowds and enthusiasm at their shows, coupled with solid songs and quality recordings, would cause the record companies to come a-sniffin’.\n\nGiven the uncertainty of today’s music industry, though, a band like CAVO wouldn’t be faulted for growing discouraged…but it hasn’t. A band like CAVO is a band that perseveres, a band that believes in its own strength, continually challenging itself while staying true to its collective vision. \n\nBut for this strength, The Painful Art of Letting Go, their second independent release, may have never been. The group endured production missteps, substance abuse and the decline of personal relationships, only to pull together in solidarity…and creativity.\n\nThe title reflects just one side of the multilayered album. Explains vocalist Casey Walker, “The album provides a unique balance of opposites: happiness and sadness, shallowness and depth. Even though we’ve all experienced loss and disappointment recently, it’s made us who we are today, and we’re quite proud of what we’ve become as a band.\"\n\n“There are definitely songs on this record that show the harsh realities of life and trying to keep your head above water,” he concedes. “Songs like ‘Awake,’ ‘Nameless’ and ‘Painful Art’ came to fruition as the band dealt with several internal and personal struggles.”\n\nFinally, the tide turned, as 2007 proved to be a good year for CAVO. After earning an opening slot with Staind, the band returned to the studio to begin writing and recording their as-yet-untitled album. They closed the year with the honor of being voted 2 indie band on Alternative Addiction.\n\nSongs from the forthcoming album are already making a splash. First single “Champagne” is garnering accolades on hometown alt-rock station 105.7 The Point; also noteworthy is “Come Undone,” a smooth cover of the Duran Duran classic featuring Republic Universal Recording artist Shannon Nicole. \n\nWith CAVO, all four members are in it together: each contributes to the songwriting process, each shares in the band’s triumphs and setbacks. Says drummer Chad Laroy, “Bands are like having four other girlfriends. That is one hell of a relationship, and it has to be fairly equal.”\n\nChris, too, recognizes the camaraderie of the quartet. His idea of success? “Having a group of your closest friends, and being able to create and play music together.” \n\nBy their own account, then, the guys in CAVO have already made it; it won’t be long before the rest of the world catches up.\n\n(2) \"Japan's mysterious Cavo, who just happen to be labelmates of the amazing (and amazingly monickered) Bathtub Shitter, and feature a member of Corrupted! The first two tracks are a bit misleading, a hazy pagan ritual of gutteral almost-throat singing, temple bells and slow chants. Reminds us a bit of Ghost or Comus. But the ritual quickly grow in intensity until it's a chaotic swirl of tribal drums, shouted vocals, sludgy low end, repetitive riffs, and thick viscous ambience. Like a primitive mix of the Boredoms and Crash Worship. The tribal melee continues, interrupted briefly with one more ambient interlude, all low end rumble and groaning vocalisations, sounding like Keiji Haino with strep throat fronting Earth. Toward the end of the record the sludge coalesces into a weirdly catchy Viking style sing-a-long, lots of WOOOAH OOH OHHH's until things wind down in a truly creepy ritual of spoken female vocals, clapping, manic chanting, shouts, screams and whistles. Comus meets the Boredoms? The Wickerman performed by Corrupted? Boris covers the Incredible String Band? More amazing and baffling Japanese weirdness!\" (Stolen from the Internet). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cavo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
