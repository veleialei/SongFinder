Always, it is original, inspired and able to strike deep chords with his listeners. It deals with real issues through real insight.\n\nIn many ways, this award-winning singer/songwriter’s life has come full circle. From his first public performances as a 12-year old in a trio with his older brother and sister, all the way through his many prestigious awards, Bruce’s musical path has been fruitful, if not always straight. He began his career in secular music, inspired as a kid by the harmonies and convictions of Peter, Paul and Mary. He pursued his dream of being a professional folk musician through the bars and supper clubs across Texas and beyond. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Carroll\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
