The band formed in December 2002, consisting of vocalist Noah Robinson, guitarists Kyle Moorman and Wayne Miller, bassist David \"Tank\" Garcia, and drummer Austin D'Amond. After being a band for only two months, Bleed the Sky played their first show as an opener for progressive death metal band Opeth. Shortly after, they independently recorded and released a demo EP, recorded at Cleveland's Spider Studios with Producer, and former Chimaira manager, Thom Hazaert and engineered and mixed by Ben Schigel.\n\nThe EP caught the attention of Emerica who was working on a compilation CD and thought Bleed the Sky would make a good addition. The EP also gained attention of locals as the band also started to headline and sellout local shows. Due to the large following that Bleed The Sky developed selling out shows along the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, CA; they received an endorsement by JÃ¤germeister. They soon caught the attention of Nuclear Blast Records. Bleed the Sky signed a worldwide deal with Nuclear Blast on November 11, 2004 and began working on their debut full length album.\n\nProducer Ben Schigel (Chimaira, Integrity, Drowning Pool) contributed his talent in the making of Paradigm in Entropy, the band's first studio album. While recording, on January 3, 2005, the band parted with bassist Casey Kulek due to \"personal reasons\". He was replaced by Daylen Elsey. The new album, Paradigm in Entropy, was released on April 19, 2005.\n\nAfter the release of the new album, Bleed the Sky began having internal issues bringing about a few lineup changes. On September 9, 2006, the band announced the departure of guitarist Kyle Moorman citing that he wanted to pursue other elements of the music business. Moorman was later replaced by David Culbert. On January 3, 2007, the band announced that guitarist Wayne Miller would be departing from the band. While on tour with Dope in June 2006, Miller was rushed to the hospital due to severe pneumonia and an unknown viral infection. He ended up getting sepsis and went into organ shock. Miller was in the hospital for 2 weeks. After getting out of the hospital, while the band was still on tour, he went home to recover. He ended up in a car accident that later left nerve damage in his left hand that required months of rehab. He was eventually replaced by Rob Thornton. Wayne Miller is still involved with the band, as he is now a key part in Bleed the Sky's business deals whilst co-managing the band alongside Archetype Management.\n\nBleed the Sky went into the studio on April 11, 2007 to record their second album. It was produced by Fear Factory's Christian Olde Wolbers; Ben Schigel mixed, and Matt Rosebery mastered. They finished recording in July 2007, but due to lineup changes and internal struggles, post-production was delayed several months. Justin Warrick joined the band and replaced David Culbert. The album is titled Murder the Dance and features a special guest appearance by Jeremy Hall from Audkik as a vocalist on one of the tracks. It was released on June 10, 2008 on Nuclear Blast Records in the US, and on Massacre Records in Europe. On May 10, the band released two new songs from the album entitled \"Sullivan\" and \"Bastion.\"\n\nThe band has been inactive as of 2009. Drummer Austin D'Amond has been playing drums for Chimaira since 2012. Former guitarist Wayne Miller is now playing guitar in Solus Deus, along with drummer Austin D'Amond and guitarist Rocky Gray, formerly of Evanescence/Living Sacifice. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bleed+The+Sky\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
