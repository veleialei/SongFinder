Formed in 1995 by Robert Ryan (vocals, electric sitar, harmonium, percussion), Mike Schweigert (guitar, Moog, percussion), and Jason Hoffman (bass), the group performed locally and worked on demos before recruiting drummer Jason Silverio and recording their 1998 debut Your Ghost Will Walk for independent Chainsaw Safety Records. New bassist Jim Baglino (ex-Human Remains and Deadguy) arrived shortly after the album sessions, but would only make his first studio appearance on Lord Sterling's self-financed 1999 EP Amplified, which garnered very positive reviews and led to further touring engagements. But various record company misfires kept sidelining the band, and it wasn't until 2002 that a second Lord Sterling album, the cleverly named Weapon of Truth (recorded in Texas and featuring cellist Megan Peters) finally emerged. More touring with the likes of Bad Wizard, Drunk Horse, and Monster Magnet ensued in 2003, and bassist Baglino also lent a hand on Monster Magnet's Monolithic Baby! album that same year. However, he was also still involved with Lord Sterling when they struck a new deal with Small Stone Records and released 2004's Today's Song for Tomorrow â€” the band's most diverse and psychedelic effort yet, which would also prove to be their last.\n\nRobert Ryan is currently a member of The Harmonize Most High sound collective which released their debut album in early 2008 on the Portuguese advant garde label Ruby Red Editora. He is also perpetually working on his solo project under the moniker of American Cloud Songs.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lord+Sterling\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
