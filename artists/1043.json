The current touring lineup consists of Hughes, Dave Catching (guitar), Eden Galindo (guitar), Matt McJunkins (bass) and Julian Dorio (drums). Homme rarely tours with the band due to commitments with Queens of the Stone Age, with Dorio, a member of The Whigs, being his current touring replacement.\n\nThe band has released four albums since their formation: \"Peace, Love, Death Metal\" (2004), \"Death by Sexy\" (2006), \"Heart On\" (2008) and \"Zipper Down\" (2015). Despite their band name, Eagles of Death Metal is not a death metal band. Hughes stated that a friend was introducing Josh Homme to the death metal genre. When he played a song by the Polish band Vader and made a claim that the song was within the death metal genre, Homme then referred to Vader as \"The Eagles of Death Metal\". After hearing this phrase, he wondered what a cross between the Eagles and a death metal band would sound like. In a 2003 interview Homme described the sound of the band as a combination of \"bluegrass slide guitar mixed with stripper drum beats and Canned Heat vocals.\" Jesse Hughes is known by fans for his enthusiastic interaction with audiences at live performances.\n\nWhile the band were on stage at Le Bataclan in Paris, France, on November 13, 2015, the audience was attacked by terrorists wielding automatic rifles, grenades and suicide vests. The death toll inside the venue was 89, including the group's merchandise manager, but the band members made it safely out of the venue via a door backstage. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eagles+of+Death+Metal\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
