The four came together after playing in various metal, punk, and hardcore combos throughout high school. As Hotwire, the sound became riff-heavy metal with vocals and dynamics influenced by post-hardcore types like Refused and Quicksand. The band recorded a few demos, and began playing shows throughout the suburban sprawl of Southern California alongside bands like Incubus, Linkin Park, Hoobastank, and Audiovent; all of which would find fame on major labels looking for the next loud thing. Soon, Hotwire got its chance, as well, and signed with RCA in December 2000. After working with a variety of big-name producers, the band issued a promotional four-song EP in late 2002. The set generated buzz for Hotwire's debut full-length Routine, which dropped in June 2003. Its release was timed to coincide with the band's appearances on that summer's Ozzfest.\n\nSoon after The Routine was released, band went on hiatus and disbanded. Vocalist Rus Martin joined alternative rock band Skyscraper Frontier and guitarist Gabriel Garcia formed The Transfatal Express, both under Coming Home Records.\n\nIn late 2010 vocalist Rus Martin helped form Rock/Alternative band Fake Figures with Atreyu guitarist Travis Miguel and former Scars of Tomorrow bassist Bob Bradley. The band released their debut EP Hail The Sycophants in December 2011 and are current playing shows and writing material for a follow-up. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Hotwire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
