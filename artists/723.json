They made their television debut on Late Night with Conan O'Brien with their hit song \"Trials\". While it wasn't their highest-charting single, \"Walk Away\" was considered their most accessible song and received its own single in stores. The band resurfaced a few years later in 2001 (after long speculation that the band had broken up) with an online single \"Say it isn't So\". The band completed a demo of six songs (produced by Jeff Tomei and Joey Huffman), about half of an anticipated upcoming album. However, with no more support from Warner Brothers or any other major labels, the band called it quits. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cool+For+August\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
