In 1993, she sang a popular duet with Paul Carrack, \"In The Time It Takes\". In early 2010 Chapman's \"Back To Love\" album was #1 on the UK itunes country charts.\n\nCo-songwriter of Faith Hill's hit song, \"This Kiss\", many other singers have interpreted her songs: Trisha Yearwood (\"Down On My Knees\"), Martina McBride (\"Happy Girl\"), Willie Nelson (“Nothing I Can Do About it Now”), Tanya Tucker (“Strong Enough to Bend”), Lorrie Morgan (“Five Minutes”), Mary Chapin Carpenter (“Almost Home”), Bette Midler (\"The Color of Roses\") and others.\n\nBonnie Raitt has sung background vocals on several songs, including \"Shake My Soul\".\n\nChapman's husband Ernest Chapman died of cancer in 1994. In 2000, Beth experienced her own battle with breast cancer. The song \"Sand And Water\" was written after Ernest's death; Elton John performed this song during his 1997 World Tour.\n\nDiscography\n\n    * Hearing It First (1980)\n    * Beth Nielsen Chapman (1990)\n    * You Hold the Key (1993)\n    * Sand and Water (1997)\n    * Greatest Hits (1999)\n    * Deeper Still (2002)\n    * Hymns (2004)\n    * Look (2005)\n    * Prism (2007)\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Beth+Nielsen+Chapman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
