Crystals functioned as a sort of supergroup, having several experienced and famous rock musicians in it. Their sound featured a blues-influenced hard rock style reminiscent of contemporaries such as Deep Purple. Crystals recorded one album in 1974 that was intended for release on the Cramps label. However, for mysterious reasons, it never appeared for years. Their work finally received a CD release in the 90s. The band's album is now regarded as an underground rock classic.\n\nThe supergroup featured former members of bands such as Premiata Forneria Marconi (Giorgio Piazza), Banco del Mutuo Soccorso (Marcello Todaro), Samadhi (Nanni Civitenga), and Alphataurus (Giorgio Santandrea). Those musicians were under the guidance of Paolo Tofani, formerly from Area. He composed all of their tracks.\n\n2.) Crystals was an indie rock band from Belarus that was formed in August 2009. Their debut album, titled 'Revolution EP', came out on 5 February 2010. That five-track release is not to be confused with the Diplo album by the same name.\n\nPlease note that \"The Crystals\", which were one of the most successful girl groups of the early 60s, is unrelated to either band that are known as merely \"Crystals\".
