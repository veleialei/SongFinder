Doing something that sounded different from old projects was the main goal. The new sound had to be more emotional, relaxed, with an overall fluid and energetic feeling... After several sessions with some musicians, they met Tiago Salsinha who soon became the drummer for the band. The work started to evolve and the first demo, with four songs, appeared very naturally. At this time, the place for bass guitar was still empty and after a few contacts the band gets in touch with a female guitar player called Inês Vicente who accepted the challenge of becoming the bass player for You Should Go Ahead. With this lineup the band dives deeper in the composition of more songs, recording their second demo in June 2005. After a few live performances producing a retro-rock sounding with some pop influence, combining different environments, using for the purpose vibrating guitars supported by frenetic and pulsating rhythms, the band had the opportunity to play at Festival Sudoeste, one of the biggest summer festivals in Portugal. You Should Go Ahead shared the same stage with LCD Soundsystem, Maxïmo Park, Devendra Banhart, Ladytron, etc. This gave the band a very good review in the press and lots of radio exposure. All of this gave the band high motivation to give the next and inevitable step, recording the album. After all the hard work producing, recording, mixing and doing every little thing involved in the making of a record, they get a contract with an independent record label in Portugal, to publish their debut record on the 29th of May 2006. The first single taken from the album is \"Like When I Was Seventeen\", mastered in New York City by Howie Weinberg, known to work with names such as Nirvana, Franz Ferdinand, Metallica, Sonic Youth, Smashing Pumpkins, etc. Pedro sings and scratches the guitar, David plays guitar and screams really loud, Inês plays bass and is a nice business woman, Tiago surfs and plays drums occasionally. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/You+Should+Go+Ahead\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
