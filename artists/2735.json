Early 2003 Dag and DanIhjel joined the band. Staff was later on replaced by Pede who also is the owner of Earplug Studio that we have used fore several recordings.\n\nThey started out with great success. Their first gig in 2003 was at a Danish death metal contest where they won the prizes as \"best performers\", \"Best guitarist\" and the audience votes for \"best band\". Since then they have played lots of gigs with Illdisposed, Gorefest, Soil, Mercenary, Sinister, Monostrosity, Vital Remains and Whelm, just to mention a few.\n\nIn 2003 they made their first demo: \"No Sympathy Left\" which was received very well by the press. In 2004 the follower \"PitchBlack promo 2004\" was made, but the output was never really that satisfying.\n\nIn November 2005 they started to record a full length album \"Designed to Dislike\". They went to the Stonelab Studio with Steen Mogensen (Royal Hunt, Cornerstone) and used a lot of time to get the product right. The album was mastered by Andy Horn and Hank Sherman (Mercyful Fate, Force of evil) made the booklet with art director Wanner. The album â€“ DESIGNED TO DISLIKE - was released summer 2007 through the German label LA RECORDS.\n\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pitchblack\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
