He has numerous international recording awards to his credit and has received an Honorary Doctorate in Music from Victoria University.\n\nHis contributions to the field of classical guitar have inspired a number of distinguished composers to write works specifically for him, including Joaquín Rodrigo, Federico Moreno Torroba, Rev.
