He started his music career as a remixer for Dutch radio stations with an oldschool tape recorder and a small Casio sampler. \n\nThrough the years he bought new and better equipment and started to develop his own unique style of production which resulted in his first record called \"Bad Dreams\" which was released in 1995 and became a huge Dutch hardcore techno hit. DJ Isaac started deejaying as well and became one of the pioneers of Dutch hardcore techno. He played all over the world in countries like America, Australia, Japan, Colombia, Russia, Italy, and Spain. \n\nIn 1999 DJ Isaac made his first club-trance remix of Hani's \"Baby Wants To Ride\" which became a top ten chart hit in Europe. After that he remixed tracks for artists like Scoop, C.R.W. (Mauro Picotto), Cosmic Gate, Brooklyn Bounce and Safri Duo. \n\nTogether with the one of the top Dutch deejay/producer duos, Pronti & Kalmani, DJ Isaac mixed the dance charts every Saturday night for more than a year on the leading Dutch radio station, Radio 538. With them he also started the hardhouse project, P.I.K. which topped the Dutch dance charts for many weeks. \n\nTogether with producer Michiel van der Kuy he contributed four tracks to the Alice Deejay album called, Who needs guitars anyway? which has achieved gold and platinum status in numerous countries worldwide. With hit records such as 'On the Edge' and 'Go Insane', DJ Isaac most definitely created a new style. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Isaac\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
