Formed around Paul Carnell and Lucia Holm (both vocals and keyboards), with a handful of contributors including Darren Woodford and Wayne Simms (guitars), Rob Fricker (bass) and Sean Wright (drums), among others.\n\nLucia Holm was a session cellist, and when she met Carnell at a warehouse rave in Essex they agreed to form a band. Early independent singles and Walk On and Pressure were medium hits in Britain, and in 1993, Love U More, and Perfect Motion from their debut album, Oâ‚ƒ (which got major distribution by Columbia/Sony), became their trademark song and one of their biggest hits to date. Their cover of the Marianne Faithfull song, Broken English in 1992 gave Sunscreem their highest UK chart position (13). They were heavily remixed throughout the 90s, by artists like K-Klass, Jimmy Gomez, Trouser Enthusiasts, and Leftfield.\n\nIn 1996, Sunscreem released their second album, Change or Die. They had a string of minor Top 40 singles from this album including When, Exodus, White Skies, and Secrets. \n\nChange or Die wasn't heavily promoted - in or outside the UK - and wasn't commercially released outside the UK, leading to Sunscreem negotiating their release from their contract with Sony. in 1997 the band released a new album via their own label, Kali: New Dark Times.\n\nOther albums released in this period were Ten Mile Bank (2001) and the collection Looking at You: The Club Anthems.\n\nIn May 2015, Sunscreem released a new album - Sweet Life - via iTunes. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sunscreem\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
