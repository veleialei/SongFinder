He has a string of hits from work with leading reggae producers. He has appeared on major music charts, won numerous awards and performed at reggae venues around the world. With a quiet energy and a winning smile, Singing Melody seduces more fans with every new song. \n\nInventive and honest in his renditions of popular North American R&B, he has perhaps become Jamaica's foremost balladeer. Born Everton Hardweare, Singing Melody first went to wax in 1987, for the legendary reggae producer, King Tubby, with Tie Mi. Among the hits that made his name in Jamaica and the Caribbean are: Same Ole Love, In This Together, Shower Me With Your Love, Groovy Kind of Love, Whatever You Want, Good Enough, and Let It Flow. In 1990, Sayonara Tokyo, a song he recorded in Japanese for Sony Music Japan, became almost an anthem. He worked steadfastly with hit making producers such as Steelie and Clevie, Sly & Robbie, Bobby “Digital B” Dixon, Edgar Parish, Jack Scorpio, and Top Ranking. In 1997, Singing Melody helped form the group L.U.S.T, with Tony Curtis, Trilla U and Lukie D. The group topped the charts with Flex Me, Run Free and the number one Sweetness of Your Love. The song won seven reggae awards, including Song of the Year and won L.U.S.T. Best Group of the Year.\n\nWhile working with LUST, singing Melody continued his solo career. He appeared at the Air Jamaica Jazz & Blues Festival, Reggae Sumfest, Sunsplash, The New York Music Festival, the Jamaican Film Festival, the Tamika Reggae Awards, the International Reggae and World Music Awards and the Reggae Soca Music Awards. He was on the television series Traxx, and won the Martin’s International Reggae and World Music Awards for Best Music Video and Most Improved Entertainer. \n\nIn 2000, Want You Back, from his album Sweeter won Song of the Year at the Reggae Soca Music Awards. He was named Male Singer of the Year by one of Jamaica’s leading entertainment newspapers and has often been featured in the Jamaica Gleaner. His hits have topped the Excess Top 20 charts and the RJR Top 40. His single, Want You Back, reached #3 and #1 respectively on the New York Reggae Top 30 and the Star Top 40. In 2002, he released Expressions, an album that showed his range and his robust expressions. It featured collaborations with L.U.S.T., Beres Hammond, and Tony Rebel, and was produced by the Fat Eyes Crew. Expressions also brought him a megahit in the single Say What. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Singing+Melody\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
