The band released its first CDep “LifeBlood” in 2001 on Warfare Records. In June 2003 Seventh Star released the full length CD “Dead End” on Facedown Records.\n\nSeventh Star has toured the US several times and has had the pleasure of sharing the stage with the likes of Agnostic Front, Hatebreed, Sick of it All, Blood for Blood, Shai Hulud, Most Precious Blood, Comeback Kid and As I Lay Dying.\n\n2004 was a turning point for Seventh Star. After returning from a winter tour in 2003 with Hoods and Haste the Day, Seventh Star were three members and one van short of a touring band. They took a hiatus in 2004 to re-group and resurfaced with singer Johnny Intraivaia and guitarist Chase Moore.\n\nWith this solidly dedicated line-up, Seventh Star plowed through 2005 releasing their heaviest, most dynamic album to date, “Brood of Vipers\".\n\nAfter a European tour they recorded \"The Undisputed Truth\" and released it on Facedown Records in 2007.\n\nMarch.29th will be their last show in 2008, They have announced that they will no longer be a band after Facedown Fest.\n\nJust wanted to add that they announced that they will be breaking up as of March 2008. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Seventh+Star\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
