As Julie Burchill noted, \"It must have been a bloody strong wind that blew the sound of Bow Bells to Surrey.\" Other songs were less commercial as they tended to be about street fighting and football hooliganism - except for the band's version of the famous West Ham United anthem, \"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles\". This violence was often mirrored at their gigs which the band sorted out themselves, Turner and Geggus had both been keen amateur boxers and had fought at national level. The Cockney Rejects expressed contempt for politicians in their lyrics even though the Cockney Rejects were staunchly pro-Britain nationalists.\nhttp://www.cockneyrejects.com/\nhttps://myspace.com/readytoruck/bio\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockney_Rejects\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCockneyRejects\nhttp://www.discogs.com/artist/254787\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cockney+Rejects\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
