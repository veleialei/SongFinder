Their 1965-vintage \"Don't You Want Me No More\" offers chiming guitars and The Byrds-like harmonies in the best early folk-rock mold, while their slightly later \"Dreaming\" could pass for a Herman's Hermits outtake. Goodlass left the group to join the somewhat more successful band the Escorts (whose members included Terry Sylvester, later of The Hollies) and was succeeded by Mervyn Sharpe. He was back in the Kirkbys' lineup following Sharpe's exit, and the group endured until the early part of the psychedelic era. Their recorded legacy includes a 1966 RCA single, \"It's a Crime\" b/w \"I've Never Been So Much in Love,\" and two songs on Unearthed Merseybeat.. \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Kirkbys\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
