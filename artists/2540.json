Their famed DJing skills and production work has built them a reputation as Europe's booty dons. Below are biographies taken from www.non-stop-djs.com\n\nDJ Brelson\n\nWith over ten years as a DJ and producer, Brelson has covered a wide range of styles since starting out playing ambient music at London's Megatripolis night in the early nineties. A fascination with Detroit artists such as Drexciya and Doppereffekt led Brelson to his first encounter with the city's ghetto tech scene in 1996, and since then the sound has come to be a deep influence on his DJing and production. Brelson continues to spin electro, techno and space-house under the name Lunar Selector, and also records spiky hard-edged electro tunes as Track Ghost.\n\nDJ Guy\n\nMeccanno has established itself as the market leader in the world of modular strip-metal toys for budding engineers, entirely eclipsing its erstwhile rival \"Zpunc\" from the public memory. Zpunc was the brainchild of international chefs Dave Back and Sent Fedge, with their first product rolling off the production line in January 1919. The chefs' revolutionary idea had been to use biscuit instead of metal, allowing children to make cranes, planes, drains and great danes to their hearts' delight which were not only safer than their metal counterparts but also edible. Their first Christmas saw sales of Zpunc and Meccanno neck and neck but over the course of 1920 Meccanno edged ahead, primarily due to the high profit margins on their larger kits. Since models made from Zpunc needed baking in order to set, there was an upper limit on the size of the kits that could be sold, restricted by the average size of a domestic oven at the time. Zpunc saw the problem, realised the solution, and decided to sell a vast oven with each kit of Zpunc, thus allowing all manner of massive biscuity toys to be constructed. DJ Guy is available now and entirely constructed from biscuit.\n\nEx-residents at London's WIDE parties, NSD have been, along with Debasser and Cutlass Supreme, at the forefront of the emergence of booty and ghettotech on Europe's dancefloors, playing alongside internationally renowned DJs including DJ Godfather, DJ Assault, Disco D, Keith Tucker, DJ Rolando, Kevin Saunderson, Rob Hood and Ed DMX. Novamute released the \"Cutlass Supreme Presents UK Bass\" mix CD in autumn 2003, which featured 3 tracks from the duo.\n\nJaws and drawers dropped when the now-legendary 112+ track All Cylinders mix (available to download exclusively from this site) appeared at the end of 2003. The mix features their now-trademark 2 deck + Ableton DJing style which throws together party-rocking butt-bouncing sounds with some of the most skilled turntablism that you'll see in dance music.\n\nThe label Non Stop Recordings was set up as an outlet for their tracks. The six-track Furious EP was released on 12\" in 2004 to a rave response, with play on the UK's BBC Radio 1, DJ support around the globe from the likes of DJ Godfather and DJ Rolando, radio play in Detroit, and electro & techno heavyweight Dave Clarke hanging the EP at the #1 spot in his May 2004 electro chart. December 2006 sees the follow-up 12\": the Retarded EP, featuring 5 tracks, 4 locked grooves, and a limited run of coloured vinyl - see the Releases page for more info. Crossing borders and mixing styles as much as their DJ sets, NSD's tracks span from electro bass, ghetto house and techno to straight up Detroit ghettotech and beyond.\n\nIn between DJing around the world, DJ Brelson & DJ Guy are currently working on the next NSD releases which will appear on Non Stop Recordings. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Non+Stop+DJs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
