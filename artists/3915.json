Her music is often described as electronic body music, with elements of rock 'n' roll and classic horror movie themes and a touch of humour. The songs are pumping, groovy and magnificently lead by Renee Cooper's captivating voice. She is the voice, body and spirit behind Zombie Girl. Zombie Girl was signed to the Alfa Matrix label. The first official Zombie Girl show was on Halloween, at the New City venue in Edmonton. Only 30 minutes in length but bearing enough power and gore to stick to the minds of those who attended for years to come.\n\nHer ex-husband Sebastian R. Komor of Icon of Coil co-founded the project and produced the music and most of the lyrics up until their split. The two disbanded and divorced in 2009 due to personal reasons. \n\nIn July 2011, Cooper announced via Facebook that she has chosen VoA VoXyd from Ad Inferna to co-write and produce her new forthcoming album, though due to scheduling conflicts, as of May 2013, Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie has been announced as the new producer.\n\nSome Zombie Girl songs can be found on different European and Mexican compilations. Creepy Crawler is featured on the industrial compilation Endzeit Bunkertracks, Act 2 (disc 3: Damage Session), We Are the Ones made the Advanced Electronics, Volume 4 (disc 1) tracklist and I Want It debut on Alfa Matrix's own Cyberl@b, Volume 5.0 (disc 2). These releases are also available in North America on the label Metropolis Records.\n\n\n2) The bass player from the Band Messer Chups. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Zombie+Girl\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
