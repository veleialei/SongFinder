Taylor's debut on record occured at age 12, recording Delilah for producer Joe Gibbs. Later, better known recordings include the poignant self-produced mid 80's lover's rock fave  \"Cottage in Negril\" which grew popular with European audiences. He worked with many producers and for a time was affiliated with Bob Marley's Tuff Gong organization.\n\nHis early 70's recordings were totems of the times and included rebel reggae titles like \"Don't Call Me Nigga\" and \"Rastafari Ruler\"  for producer Clancy Eccles, and 1975's \"Move On Blackman\" cut with producer Sydney Crooks. Other mid 70's singles included \"Life Table\" and \"I'd Like to Know\" done with Jack Ruby. In 1977 \"Sufferation\"  done with Niney The Observer was also released in a dub form, mixed by King Tubby.\n\nIn 1980, he re-teamed up with producer Joe Gibb's and attempted a rasta rework of McFadden and Whitehead's Philly soul staple \"Ain't No Stopping Us Now\" as \"Can't Stop Rastaman Now\"\n\n\"Cottage in Negril\" was likely his biggest hit with lyrics about missing a lover whose gone away. The song, which included the timely sound of cocaine being snorted mid-way through, also was a commentary on Jamaica's changing political and social scene, and lead to a contract with MCA. Unfortunately for Taylor, the major deal failed to generate much new attention, and the label failed to release the album he recorded, or promote his touring appearances.\n\nNot many notable hit recordings followed his early 80's peak, but in 1987 he released the minor singles \"Members Only\" and \"Be For Real!\". By 1993 he had returned to working with Willie Lindo, who produced the mostly covers collection \"The Way To Paradise\". In 1994 Clive Hunt, produced the hit single \"Rainy Sunset\"\n\nBefore his death from prostate cancer, Tyrone spoke openly of a substance abuse problem that he felt had derailed his once promising career. Taylor had been confined to a wheelchair and had suffered two strokes in recent years before his death and left behind 9 children. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tyrone+Taylor\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
