Virus was a short-lived German band that released just two LP's during their brief existence: 'Revelation' (early '71) and 'Thoughts' (late '71). Though they've been often tagged as a krautrock band, Virus was actually a hard rock/psych '70's ensemble from the Bielefeld/Westphalia area. They also released superb live album 'Remember', which was recorded at Koln on April 28, 1973 for WDR Radio show. \n\n03. One of the most influential Spanish language bands, Virus was an electro-pop and New Wave band from Argentina which was led by Federico Moura until his death in 1988. They are considered pioneers of modern pop music in Latin America.\n\n04. American punk band. \n-VIRUS was formed in 1982 by a few disenchanted with \"NYHC music scene\" old school hardcore punks:Kontra (Throat) Natz (Bass) Blank(Skins) and Jimi Human(Axe).We were old mates hanging on St. Marks Stoops since mid seventies.Our tribe released a 12\" EP \"Dark Ages\" on Rat Cage Records in 1984, then imploded while exploding on it's first world tour in 1985....\nhttp://www.myspace.com/virusnyhc\n\n05. Korean indie band.\n\n06. Japanese visual keirock/speed metal band. Please change tags to Ｖｉｒｕｓ.\n\n07. Russian techno band.\n\n08. American christian techno band from NSOUL Records.\n\n09. British Thrash metal band.\n- The band was formed in London, UK in 1986 by Henry Heston (Vocals / Guitar) and Tez Kaylor (Drums) who had played together in various punk bands from the age of fourteen and later, hardcore / metal. They were joined by John Hess (Bass) and Coke McFinlay (Lead Guitar) in 1987. Later that same year they recorded and produced their debut album, Pray For War which was released on the MetalWorks label.\n\nAn October 87 tour with Celtic Frost and Kreator took the band to numerous venues throughought the UK  culminating in a  a show at  the reknowned Hammersmith Odeon in London.\n\nOver the next couple of months they wrote more material, rehearsed, recorded and played  two more major gigs. The first was supporting Cro-Mags at Hammersmith Clarendon and was followed by the fabled 'Christmas On Earth' gig at Queens Hall, Leeds two days later. \n\nVirus were the opening act in a line-up that included  Laaz Rockitt, Cro-Mags, Kreator,  Overkill, Nuclear  Assault,  and Megadeth. Apart from Megadeth no-one got a sound check  and the Virus set was effectively used to get the sound system up and running. The gig did not go down well with the press. Fortunately, the large audience supported the band and praised them for  attempting to continue in the face of overwhelming odds.\n\nThe band's second album, Force Recon,  appeared in April  1988 and this time the press reviews where more favourable. The general consensus of opinion was that the band had improved considerably. The band themselves regarded this album as their true debut as it was the first album to include Coke McFinlay's guitars (who joined the band too late to feature on the recording of the Pray For War album). It and was also recorded and mixed in more proffessionaly set surroundings.\n\nIn July 1988 the band played the support slot on Death Angel's UK tour which took in most major venues throughout England and Wales. At the end of the tour Virus headed back to London to record for the BBC's flagship, 'Friday Rock Show' at their studios in Maida Vale.\n\nIn the meantime Combat Records had released Force Recon in America and with minimal advertising the album sold in sizeable numbers. Combat also set up a US tour with the band supporting Death and DBC. The tour, scheduled for October 1988 eventually fell apart and the band never made it to the US that year.\n\nDespite this setback, or perhaps because of it, the band returned to the rehearsal studios and started to write material for a new album. The album, Lunacy, was recorded at Raezor Studios, London in May 1989 and was scheduled for release worldwide via MetalWorks / AVM in July. Unfortunately, due to distribution problems, the release was delayed until September causing the cancellation of the short tour that had been scheduled for July. \n\nIn the Summer of 1990 Virus lost members John Hess and Coke McFinlay due to personal differences within the band. Henry and Tez left England for the U.S where they auditioned musicians for a new line-up. Eventually Virus USA took shape with new members Benny Herb (Vocals), Mark Baronowski (Bass), and Sid Sholly (Guitar). Demos were recorded and attracted considerable interest from the American press as well as various major labels. Unfortunately due to economic cicumstance, funding dried up and the US projects could not continue.\n\nLeaving the US, Virus went back to England but the American members were refused entry to the UK by immigration authorities and 'red tape' so the band decided to finally and reluctantly hang up their boots and concentrate on other projects.\n\nIn 2008, after eighteen years, Coke revived Virus, recruiting  Sam Brandon (Rhythm Guitar), Matt Cooper (Bass) and Dave Sherwood (Drums) with himself (Lead Guitar) as well as taking over the main vocal duties. The band continue to tour extensively, under the premise \"Heavier, Louder, Thrashier\".\n\nInfo: www.myspace.com/virusthrash / www.metalworksrecords.co.uk/virus\n\n09. Happy Hardcore DJ.\n\n10.
