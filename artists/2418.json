He has worked extensively with Washington D.C.-based duo Deep Dish, co-writing, co-producing, performing and singing on many of their tracks, most notably on their albums Junk Science and George Is On.\n\nAs a dance music producer and remixer, he has released an extensive number of club hits using the names Morel and Pink Noise. Notable artists he has provided remixes for include Mariah Carey, Pet Shop Boys, Tina Turner, New Order, Depeche Mode, Filter, Yoko Ono, Seal, and The Killers.\n\nIn 1995 Morel started his own independent record label called Outsider Music. He released \"Peterbilt Angel\" and the \"4-Track\" cds on Outsider. Morel worked briefly with James Bradford. Bradford would go on to appear on the reality telvision show Can't Get a Date, where Bradford's inability to get past Morel's unceremonious dumping of Bradford from the label would be cited as one of the things holding Bradford back from a successful life. Morel has collaborated with Ute Lemper and Daniel Ash for Outsider Music releases.\n\n\nIn 2002 he released Queen Of the Highway on Deep Dish's Yoshitoshi label. The album, which contained not only house music tracks but also had modern rock, pop and hip-hop elements throughout, impressed many critics. The autobiographical and introspective lyrics helped to earn the album its critical praise. Included on the record are some of his past club hits: \"True (The Faggot Is You),\" \"Funny Car (Love Is Dead)\" and \"Cabaret.\" Technically, the album is released by a band also called Morel, fronted by Richard.\n\nAlso in 2002, he began running a monthly dance event with friend and veteran punk/alternative/indie icon Bob Mould, titled Blowoff. Blowoff is also the name of an electronic duo that Morel and Mould have been recording an album under.\n\nAfter several more club hits and remixes, Morel returned with a second album, Lucky Strike, in 2004. Again praised by critics, the follow-up was an extension of sounds and lyrical content of his first. Included here are his club hits \"If You Love Me,\" \"Under a Disco\" and \"Escape (Driving To Heaven),\" a collaboration with producer 16B.\n\nIn 2005, Morel became part of Bob Mould's new touring unit (along with another notable DC musician, Fugazi drummer Brendan Canty), formed to support the release of Mould's 'Body Of Song album. Morel also contributed remixes of the track \"(Shine Your) Light Love Hope\" to the bonus disc included in the limited edition version of the album.\n\nAs of 2006 Bob Mould & Morel are now redefining pop music with their Blowoff project. Blowoff, named after the deciding fight in a pro wrestling match, fuses together Mould's angry, angular power-pop tendencies with Morel's hazy, house-fueled electronica. The result is nothing less than a superb first album that offers the listener a level of musical adventurousness and stunning songcraft that has few peers in the pop and dance music worlds today.\n\nBlowoff marks the first project in which both Mould and Morel have taken equal turns in writing, playing the guitar and keyboards, creating rhythm tracks and breathing into the mike. And as listeners will hear from the album’s very first track, “Hormone Love”, Blowoff is an impressive merger between two highly independent musicians whose individual virtuosity is unparalleled and whose musical roots span rock, punk, funk, pop, electronica and deep house.\n\nWith Blowoff, Mould and Morel produce music that isn’t like anything you’d expect. Although Blowoff features hard-charging rock tunes (\"Here And Now\") as well as blazing dance tracks (\"Tag It\"), the album's chief distinction is a poignant, compelling pop intensity that blends powerful songwriting and gorgeous melodies with great hooks and superb beats. Without a doubt, Blowoff will strongly appeal to fans of both rock and dance music, as well as pop aficionados.\n\nCoinciding with this release Mould and Morel will be taking their famed Blowoff party, held once a month at DC’s famed 9:30 Club, on the road. Featuring both men Djing, as well as performing a live set of Blowoff songs, the Blowoff parties attract a wide cross-section of people from all walks of life, providing a rare meeting ground for everyone from music-loving hipsters to beer-drinking men's men to dance music enthusiasts to leather daddies to the muscle men featured in Blowoff's signature artwork.\n\n2.Morel a Greek Post Punk. \n\nPost Punk/New Wave band active during the late 80's created by George Koukio, Michael  Vernardakis, Nick Sidirokastritis and Vangeli Peppa. Released two albums in 1987 and 88 by Ano Kato Records.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Morel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
