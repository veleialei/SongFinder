Chris Volz met with now ex-Five.Bolt.Main members Ivan Arnold and Ben Patrick – whom both were part of Flaw prior to their breakthrough album Through the Eyes (2001). At the time, both Ivan and Ben were in a project called \"Silent Q\", which by the time Flaw disbanded, had enough material written to put an album together. Silent Q included guitarists Aaron Welenken and Jason Chandler. At this point Chris joined the band, which was tentatively titled \"Vent\", but was later changed to \"Five.Bolt.Main\" due to legal reasons. Within 7 months the band had scored themselves a record deal with independent label Rock Ridge Music.\n\nFive.Bolt.Main's debut album Venting was released on September 13, 2005. The band has gone through several line-up changes since its release. Roughly a month after the album was released, members Jason Chandler, Ben Patrick and Aaron Weleken left the group. Rock Ridge Music claimed \"musical differences\" and \"unforeseen rigors of the road\" as the reasons for leaving. However, the exiting members cited Chris Volz's alcohol and drug abuse. Kobie Jackson (Primer 55), Alex Cando (Darwin’s Waiting Room) and Ronny Paige were recruited to fill in, with Alex and Ronny later staying on a permanent basis. To date, the album has sold nearly 25,000 copies which some would consider to be a decent amount due to the lack of exposure the band had.\n\nJune 2006 also saw the departure of Ivan Arnold, following an infamous onstage physical altercation at Club Sonar, in Baltimore, MD with an intoxicated Volz. The band disbanded shortly thereafter, though reunion rumors continue to surface. \n\nOn October 10, 2006, Rock Ridge Music released an unauthorized Live album which was recorded in Louisville during Five Bolt's 2006 tour. Band members have made various public statements disowning the album, citing low production quality.\n\nMost recently, a February 2011 Facebook post attributed to Volz expressed his desire to continue with efforts to finish material for a second studio album in collaboration with Ronny Paige. Other former members continue to refuse to work with Volz, due to concerns over the singer's alleged continued substance abuse and track record of violent outbursts.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Five+Bolt+Main\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
