In December of 1990 an Epiphany of sorts intervened inspiring founding members Daniel Ian Essex (Guitar, Vocals) and Eyajo Joseph (Keyboards, Lyrics) to plumb the depths of their naturally vampiric natures and regroup as \"Astrovamps\"-a moniker much more adequately suited to their newly realized hymns of the morose, the rotting and the perversely romantic. Whether a proctorial survival tactic or the shedding of flamboyant skin their former incarnation was better left to the ran shackled remnants of a bygone 'era as the newly christened Astrovamps proceeded with relish into a newly mysterious decade. Considering most of the templates which kick started the movement into shape were now relegated to the Deathrock graveyard, such as ''The Batcave'' and ''Zombie Zoo'' (which not ironically inspired the cult favorite \"Zombie Dance\") a new breed was needed to plunder the crypt's for fresh bones and thus reinvent the 'genre.\n\nAnno 1991 welcomed the release of \"Savage Garden\" marking a distinctive turn in musical composition from clow'esque charade to full blown netherworld cherubs. And it only got more vicious when the incubus duo initiated Vincent D'priest (Bass) and the madcap miscreant of a decidedly non-human nature Toe Knee from ''Willow Wisp'' on Drums. Their first foray to harvest rancid fruit was 1993's much lauded minor piece, the critically underrated \"Blood And Flowers\" e.p. which for all of it's lacking in production value was more than compensated for in the songwriting department. Performing consistently sold out shows (Astrovamps played shows with many great bands, through out their history thus far, like... the Phantom Chords, Hell Fire Club, Kommuninty FK, Apoptygma Berzerk, Wednesday 13 and Eva O. Just to name a few.) and in 1993 proudly opened for the last incarnation of legendary death rock icons \"Christian Death\" before Rozz William's suicide in 1998. \n\nIn 1995 Dark Poet Eyajo Joseph released his book of witch grimores in the form of \"Where Elfin Children Play\" a stunning text of art, verse and philosophy whilst the Gothic Hugh Hefner himself Daniel Ian starred in a number of adult oriented Gonzo spectaculars. That same year and next in their strategic plan of attack was actually a self titled debut that was recorded but never properly promoted or released. The falsely fledgling label ''Keltic Records'' which mercilessly and unapologetically folded left the album to dwell in obscurity. Undaunted, the ever transversing charlatans enlisted the archaic velocity of Corwin (Bass) and thus began a new chapter. One that would come to bare the brunt of labors committed since the band's inception. Among the myriad plethora of approaching recordings first and foremost was \"Manifesto\" the debut e.p. of a cryonigized corpse thought deceased after a few years of inactivity.\n\nRevitalized by a resurgence in the worldwide deathrock contingent and their demand for new ''Vamps product'', the band wasted little time in securing a deal with maverick deathrock German label \"Alice In...\" who proudly rewarded every salaciously wet goth girl's dream with the re-release of ''Manifesto'' followed by \"Amerikan Gothick\" a nineteen song sacrament brimming with aristocratic hooks, brooding melancholy, dire deviation and haunting surrealism. It's complexity (gorged with melody) was able to do what others in a similar field could not- attain pure euphoria and shape shifting dream flight as it enveloped your essence in it's rich tapestry of transcendence. \n\nDuring this fertile apex of creative musings the Vamps found precious time to flex muscles of other sorts with a multitude of willing succubi in their spare time. They also traveled to the land of heretic composer supreme Johann Sebastian Bach-Leipzig, Germany on Friday May 13, 2005 to annihilate all and sundry at The prestigious ''Wave Gotik Treffen Festival.'' Needless to say many inebriated shenanigans took part and parcel. Like Caligula dressed as Dracula in a brothel. Which, logically, brings us to the present day and the current state of affairs for our moribund night walkers. The recently released Deathrock hallmark \"Gods And Monsters\" (2007 Alice In...) has been thrust upon an unsuspecting public which will surely be taken aghast. Our blood swilling hero's are not resting on their laurels though and have enlisted new recruits Glass Ghost (lead guitar, who's guitar artistry is introduced on Astrovamps newest release Gods and Monsters) and Grim De La Noche (Bass) who adds a drearily misanthropic vibe coupled with a flamboyant urgency that works well within the band's kinetic web of innovation. Recently our hoary cretins were honored to be featured on the \"Kaliffornian Deathrock\" compilation with the exclusive inclusion of their Deathrock cult cut \"Ghost Train\". This , i assume, will only add to the phantasmagoria that has and always will be the destiny of the Astrovamps. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Astrovamps\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
