With Marygold though, you won't only be hearing, you will also be feeling. After all music isn't only for your ears but also for your soul.\n\nThe band began in Autumn 2001, with a group of musicians, who had already lost their milk teeth in other bands, and Marygold then set about, playing across Switzerland from one end to another, with explosive rock and passionate emotion. Emotion, that is not quickly forgotten. It's emotion that you will immediately recognise.\n\nThe first longplayer \"Turned Left But Don't Know If It Was Right\" was recorded in Spring 2003 by Master Deezl Imhof in Foolpark Studio : an extremely ripe and full sounding CD, which caught the stage energy perfectly. Rock'n'Roll and melancholy.\n\nThe brand new album \"Dare, Dare... Surrender\" marks a turning point in the music of the band. It was worked on for nearly a year, with much experimentation and the crossing of musical borders, without losing sight of the target. The music has acquired a new depth and at the same time a new grandeur: The extreme sadness has achieved differentiation. Sink with a hundred kilos of weight on your feet, into the sky. That's how the audience will feel at a Marygold concert.\n\nMarygold are:   \nPHILIPE BURRELL, voc, guit.\nCLAUDIO RENGGLI, guit.\nPATRIK ZOSSO, dr. & samples\nK-CEE SCHINZ, bass & voc.\n\nFurther Information:\nMyspace Page\nLabel Page\n\n\nLe second vient de France:\nCrée en 2001 à Istres (Bouches-du-Rhône, France), Marygold est un groupe pop/rock qui voit sa musique mêlée de mélancolie et de riffs puissants. Puisant son inspiration dans la vie de tous les jours, Marygold s'inspire musicalement de groupes comme Radiohead, Muse, Smashing Pumpkins, etc...\n\nIls ont auto-produit 2 albums : \"Requiem\" en 2003, enregistré à Istres et \"Rien d'Innocent\" en 2005, enregistré près de Nîmes.\n\nMarygold c'est :\nYann : chant\nJu : guitare\nYo : basse\nNico : batterie <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Marygold\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
