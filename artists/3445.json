The Insects had written music for several documentaries, an animated feature film 'Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb', feature film 'Love and Death on Long Island' starring John Hurt and Jason Priestly, TV commercials and CD-Roms. Recently they have written the score for the horror film 'Creep', 'XX/XY', and 'Owning Mahony' featuring Philip Seymour Hoffman and Minnie Driver.\nIn 2016 The Insects composed the soundtrack for the BBC's acclaimed supernatural drama \"The Living and The Dead\" featuring the vocal talents of Cocteau Twins vocalist Elizabeth Fraser on the old english folk song \"She Moved Through The Fair\". \nThe soundtrack is a digital only release and can be obtained through The Insects website here :-\nhttp://www.theinsects.co.uk/?p=486\n\n\n\n2) The Insects are a three-piece experimental basement terror-noise band. Currently based in the crack infested streets of Drumheller, Alberta; They formed in 2007 when guitarist Brett Doyle, a huge Alkaline Trio fan, approached estranged drummer Brent Clift, another huge trio fan and asked if he was interested in jamming. Some covers were played without bass and it was decided a bassist was needed. Brent and Brett decided to enroll bassist and burn-out Josh Leonhardt. The ball was rolling. The bands sound is diverse as the influences are as well. The bands sound incorporates everything from old school hardcore, to grind with touches of surf rock and mathcore. Along with DethKunt and The Splattercats, The Insects belong to a group known as D.K.U(DethKunt United) which consists of eight members collectively.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Insects\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
