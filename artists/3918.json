Zuma (Rock quartet)\nPortsmouth based rock quartet, Zuma took their name from the 1975 Neil Young and Crazy Horse album, Zuma.\n\nTheir inspiration for this came not only from their shared fondness for the album, but also from the musical philosophy the album demonstrates - a philosophy which emphasises the importance of delivering beautifully crafted, tuneful songs in a colourful and honest way. The band are particularly suited to this philosophy and feel that their sound owes greatly to it.\n\nZuma's conception took place when, due to shared musical tastes and values, Chris, Steve and James decided to bond their friendship into a band. Writing and recording, the three honed their sound and became musically ensconced. The completion of the band's line-up was marked by the arrival of Tim in late 2005, and thus Zuma was born.\n\nAlso check out\nWWW.PUREVOLUME.COM/ZUMA \n\n2. Zuma (Pop/Electronica/Electro Duo)\nA Norwegian duo made up of Alexander Stenerud (vocals & guitar) and Henrik Njaa (keyboards and programming). \nThe bands' website is located at www.zuma.no. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Zuma\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
