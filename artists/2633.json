They had three releases on Polyvinyl Record Company. After the amazing \"Brazilliant\" EP and corresponding tour in 2000, they broke up. \n\nIt seemed that it was the end; some said the break up was a ploy to get away from Polyvinyl, a rumor born from the fact that the band didn't play any Pre-Break PTX songs in their live shows. \n\nUnreleased songs from Paris, Texas soon surfaced as the demo/EP \"Action Fans Help Us!\". The band reunited in 2003 and was signed to New Line Records releasing a final album \"Like You Like an Arsonist\", including re-recordings of songs from \"Action Fans Help Us!\" in 2004. Paris, Texas called it quits in 2005.\n\nCMJ New Music Magazine said:\n\"Furious punk guitars that sound more rock than emo, backed by chaotic but somehow precise drumming...it's hard to believe Paris Texas were ever considered emo at all - there's much more bark than whine.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Paris,+Texas\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
