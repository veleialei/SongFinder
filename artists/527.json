C.C. Adcock is featured in the True Blood soundtrack.\n\nHe has performed and recorded with the south Louisiana 'supergroup' Lil' Band of Gold, which, in addition to Adcock, consists of swamp pop pioneer Warren Storm on drums, accordionist Steve Riley of the Mamou Playboys; Richard Comeaux of River Road; and pianist David Egan. Adcock also performed with Lil' Buck Senegal's Cowboy Stew Blues Revue, based in Lafayette.\n\nAdcock appears often with swamp pop veterans like Storm, Rod Bernard and Tommy McLain, and in the 1990s he coaxed out of retirement swamp pop pioneers King Karl and Guitar Gable.\n\nDespite his frequent association with swamp pop music and its artists, Adcock does not consider himself a swamp pop musician, given the harder edge of his guitar-driven sound, and his experimentation with non-traditional recording techniques.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/C.C.+Adcock\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
