This mini-album is his best work to date and the documentation of a journey that took him to Ghana, Berlin and the Highlands of Scotland.\n\nFollowing a music project in Africa organised by Glasgow’s Green Door Studios, Rick decamped his entire studio to a community-run barn in the Scottish Highlands. Sometimes alone, sometimes with visiting friends (inc Chris Hardwick- drums, Scott Cousins- bass, Eilidh Mcmillan- cello & backing vocals), Rick began sketching out and recording new song ideas inside a small hall in the barn. Two months later he emerged with seven fully-formed songs that after some further production tweaks in Glasgow, would become The Highest Mountains.\n\nThe album draws influence from Nick Cave, Sun Kil Moon, Sigor Ros and has an analogue, raw feel to the production thanks to Green Door studio’s Samuel J Smith who mastered The Highest Mountains. Tracks such as And I Know embody the uplifting, autobiographical melody featured throughout this mini-album which has bursts of fuzz, folk and pop. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Unkle+Bob\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
