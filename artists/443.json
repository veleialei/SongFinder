This collaboration has established him as an ambassador of both the classical and jazz worlds. His recordings have sold over 20 million copies.\n\nIn addition to his vocal performing career, Mr. McFerrin was appointed in 1994 as creative chair of the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra.\n\nHe is the subject of a persistent yet wholly unfounded rumour that he has committed suicide. The rumor was so strong that the official Bobby McFerrin FAQ addressed the question.\n\nMr. McFerrin and his oft-maligned hit \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\" were parodied on \"The Simpsons\" as \"I'm Worried - Need Money\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+McFerrin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
