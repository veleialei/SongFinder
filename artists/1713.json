His phrasing and musical sensibility is enchanting; creating in an instant, a beautiful Parisian cafe or dance-hall in the mind of any listener who closes his eyes and lets his thoughts wander where they will. Jo played with all the greats and can be heard on many albums - sometimes credited and sometimes not - but fans can recognize his musical voice. He was born in Menilmontant France and is primarily known for being the sound of the Balajo dance hall for nearly five decades, and also for  his album \"Jo Privat - Manouche Partie\" which is one of the seminal albums in the Musette musical genre.\n\nMore info on Jo Privat can be found at his fansite:\nhttp://swingjo.apinc.org\n\nOr at the gypsy and Musette site, Djangostation: \nhttp://www.djangostation.com/Jo-Privat,370.html <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jo+Privat\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
