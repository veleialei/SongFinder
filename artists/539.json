(1997's Power of the Night and 1998's The Bloody Way) they began adopting more melodic and folk music elements. \nThus transformed, Cadacross -- featuring screeching vocalist Georg Laakso, guitarist Tommi Saari, keyboardist Mathias Nygеrd, bassist Jarkko Lemmetty, and drummer Janne Salo -- made their debut with 2001's \"So Pale Is the Light\" album, which was released by the independent Low Frequency label.\n\nCadacross' metamorphosis was not yet complete. However, when vocalist Laakso informed his comrades that their next album would take them even further away from their violent death metal roots, everyone in the band either quit or was fired. Unperturbed, Laakso picked up a guitar and proceeded to surround himself with new members Sami Aarnio (vocals), Tino Ahola (guitar), Jukka-Pekka Miettinen (bass), Antti Ventola (keyboards), Nina Laakso (backing vocals), and Kimmo Miettinen (drums) prior to recording 2002's epic metal opus \"Corona Borealis\".\n\nGeorg Laakso was later in a motoring accident, and the future of the band was uncertain.\n\nNowadays though Georg Laakso is back home and recovering from his accident. (maybe planning some new tracks). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cadacross\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
