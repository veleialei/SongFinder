Her debut album, Small Fires, garnered rave reviews and it wasn't long before the world recognized her talents. Songs from her second release, the EP Hors D'Oeuvres, found their way into shows such as Grey's Anatomy and Veronica Mars. Her track \"Lost and Found\" was featured alongside Spoon and Tegan and Sara on the soundtrack album for the latter. Adrienne's music has since been heard on dozens of popular television shows. Early in her career she was chosen to play at Lilith Fair and was later signed to Nettwerk Records. Jeff Trott (Sheryl Crow) produced Pierce's second full length album, Faultline, which featured performances by a stellar group of musicians who also play with Beck and Sting. Pierce has toured extensively including dates with Damien Rice, Sondre Lerche and Stereophonics. She has performed live on BBC Radio and after opening for Ray LaMontagne in Toronto a member of Radiohead praised her performance. \n\nAdrienne is now set to release her much anticipated third album, \"Oh Deer\" and will be kicking off her tour at Bergenfest in Norway. \n\nwww.adriennepierce.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Adrienne+Pierce\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
