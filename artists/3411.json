Their first single for the label was a remake of an early 20th century hit HAPPY DAYS AND LONELY NIGHTS.  The record charted at number 18 in Billboard and their hit string began.  One of their follow up releases, HEARTS OF STONE, not only established them as recording stars, but also topped the Billboard charts.  By the end of their chart career in 1959, the Fontanes had placed 24 singles on the Billboard Pop charts.  A number of others were also listed on the Cashbox charts at a time when they ran to 40 or 50 places while Billboard charts had between 20 and 30 positions. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Fontane+Sisters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
