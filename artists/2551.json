Vocalist, dj, producer, radio dj and journalist. Known for her numerous collaborations with Futro, Smolik, Fisz, Vienio & Pele, Adamus and others, all of whom appeared on her album \"Feat. Novika\" (Sissy, 2004). In Radiostacja she hosted her - now legendary - show \"Radio Lazy Sunday\" for 5 years. Then she moved to Jazz Radio for a while and ended up in national radio for young people - BIS. Here she serves lazy and experimental electronic sounds and presents new local talents. She supports Polish artists and djs also through compilations (Radio Leniwa Niedziela, Sissy 2002; Polskie Leniwe, Kayax 2005).\n\nAs a DJ, Nowicka can never decide on one style for too long. First she played down tempo both in clubs and the radio. Then she tried deep house and started performing as a vocal - MC with house djs. Bored with the routine of single gigs all over Poland and concerned with the lack of music diversity in clubs, Nowicka decided to set up her own DJ collective, Beats Friendly.\n\nToday she plays a blend of electro & deep house / deep techno plus electronic dub, always searching for a special groove coming from a haunting melody, funk elements or driving bass.\n\nShe has performed at major Polish festivals (Astigmatic, Heineken Open'er, Era New Horizons), in Paris (Closing of Polish Year in France) and Japan (Expo).\n\n2006 is a new era. Nowicka wants to concentrate on singing again and looking for opportunities to release her music outside Poland. In January she releases her first vinyl \"Finally\" under her own Beats Friendly label. It's a dance EP recorded with the best Polish producers: Jacek Sienkiewicz, Agim, Envee and drum'n'bass duo CLS + Wax (go to music).\n\nMeanwhile she's working on her proper debut solo album, completely different to the vinyl, more personal and sensual.\n\nAt 27.10.2006 Nowicka finally released her awaited solo album called \"Tricks of Life\".\n\n(2) A Malaysian singer who d√©buted with Yang Kusayang Sudah Punya Orang (Sep 2014). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Novika\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
