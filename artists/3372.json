The group came from London and were managed by Doug Smith, then manager of Motorhead. They were included as part of the unique but short lived NuDisk releases in the USA - 10\" EP's . Elvis Costello was also one of the artists released in this format in the USA.  Music was largely  New Wave high energy although other tracks reflected a wider and different style.  Fizz Pop Modern Rock received good air play but the follow up single 'Housewives Delight' was less well received by radio stations. Probably due to the lyrics which were about DJs at the time!  Bill Holliday and Tom Doherty also co-produced and wrote tracks for the highly rated Rockabilly group 'Whirlwind' .\nThe title of the Single 'Fizz Pop Modern Rock' was used for two compilation albums released in the USA by Epic featuring a range of hi energy music.\n\n2) 1960s Garage/Psych band from Georgia, US.\n\n3) International christian ministry (Continental Singers) started by Cam Floria in 1963. The Continentals have recorded over 60 albums. There are several groups (e.g. The Continental Voices And Brass, The Young Continentals, The Encore Continentals, Continental Kids, etc, etc) who play over 1,600 concerts a year.
