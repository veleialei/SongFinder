In 1993 they went to number one on the United States Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart twice. \"I'm Gonna Get You\" spent two weeks at number one in January (also hitting number 47 on the Billboard Hot 100) and was followed by \"Took My Love,\" which was number one for two weeks in late April. Both tracks featured lead vocals by female session singer Angie Brown. A third song (not featuring Brown), \"Love In Motion,\" hit number four on the dance chart in late 1993. However their most successful tune to date has remained Playing With Knives (which would later serve as the basis for rival act Blue Pearl's number one Hot Dance Club Play hit \"Can You Feel The Passion\" in 1992).\n\nAll three of Bizarre Inc.'s big hit singles appeared on their first album, Energique, in 1992. They also released a second album, Surprise, in 1996. Two-thirds of the original line-up are now putting out new music under the name Chicken Lips. In the UK, their biggest singles were Playing with Knives (#4) and Im gonna Get you (#3), the latter of which was a genuine cross over dance/pop hit and was within the top 40 biggest sellers of the year. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bizarre+Inc.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
