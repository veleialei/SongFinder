Rock.\n\nVictor Love: Producer, Vocals, Guitar, Synthesizers, Drum Machine\nLa Nuit: Guitar\nDarin Yevonde: Bass\nAsh Rexy: Keyboards\n\nWith lyrics inspired by Cyberpunk imagery and the Cyberpunk subculture, Dope Stars Inc. have been mixing industrial beats, acid synths and distorted sounds with a bratty rock’n’roll sound and attitude since their foundation in May 2003, Italy.\n\nWith their debut self-produced EP “10,000 Watts Of Artificial Pleasures” the band caught the interest of the international press and and was quickly signed with Trisol Music Group to release two albums,“Neuromance” (2005) and “Gigahearts” (2006).\n Through the years they have infected a horde of loyal fans and spread like a virus over communities and global networks. \n\nThe band toured extensively between 2005 and 2008 performing on stages across Europe and supporting bands like London After Midnight, Kirlian Camera, ASP, Apoptygma Berzerk, Nightwish, Combichrist, My Dying Bride, and others. The band also performed at European festivals like Mera Luna, Wave Gotik Treffen, Amphi Festival, Summer Darkness, On A Dark Winter Night, Infest UK, and Trash Fest I & II in Finland. Songs by Dope Stars Inc. also appear on  the soundtrack albums of the horror movie saga \"Saw\".\n\nTheir 3rd studio album (upcoming this summer) has been licensed to Trisol Music Group in Europe, Metropolis Records in North American and Subsound Records in Italy. Before it's release an advance EP including 2 tracks from the new album and titled \"Criminal Intents / Morning Star - Double Feature EP\" will be released on 21st April 2009. After the EP some concert dates are being planned in May and an International Tour will follow after the full length album release.\n\nLinks:\n\nhttp://www.dopestarsinc.com\nhttp://www.twitter.com/dopestarsinc\nhttp://www.facebook.com/dopestarsinc\nhttp://www.myspace.com/dopestarsinc\nhttp://www.vampirefreaks.com/dopestarsinc.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dope+Stars+Inc.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
