Since the very beginning of his career, Eason has been one of the favorites to lead the new generation of Cantopop.  He has been described as a breath of fresh air in the HK music scene.  Over the last ten years, Eason Chan emerged as the leading male singer of his generation, fulfilling his role as an innovator and a leader in the HK music scene, winning prestigious awards one after another.  Eason Chan has also been successful in his work in the Mandopop scene. He has won numerous awards in both Mainland and Taiwan, most notably Taiwan's Golden Melody Award. \"Admit It\" was a another notable work of Eason Chan, which led to a nomination for Golden Melody Award's Best Male Singer; the award was ultimately won by Gary Chaw.\n\nEason Chan has been named by Chinese critics as the next God of Songs (歌神) after Jacky Cheung. However, Eason has more than once clarified that he wishes to build his own name instead, and not just be the successor of Jacky Cheung.  There is a duet called 天下太平 sung by Chan and Jacky Cheung in the album Perfect Match by Albert Leung，Ronald Ng (伍樂城) released in April 2006. Chan and Cheung have collaborated on other occasions as well. They sang a duet of Cheung's 頭髮亂了 in a fundraising campaign for SARS victims in 2003.\n\nChan not only sings but also plays a variety of musical instrument including piano, violin, accordion, guitar and drums. He frequently showcases his musical talent by incorporating instruments into his live performances. Chan is also a song-writer who has written many songs, some included in his albums.\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/%E9%99%B3%E5%A5%95%E8%BF%85\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
