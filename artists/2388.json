I was very curious as what to expect. Embarrassingly, I have to admit. Previous to this night, “cruiser love” had been the only tracked I had heard. Though that song does get me groovin’ every time. May I say to you boys of the Mix Mob crew……you F*?kin rock!!!! How these sounds have eluded me this far is wretched. Even before the first note was bashed, even the first cymbal brushed, Big W had the crowd mobbin’. Now can you imagine what happened immediately following the opening of the first song? Sheer mayhem, mass hysteria. This is one of my most loathed and dreaded parts of this job. For those of you who, like me, weren’t hip to them, I’d say. Take Limp Bizkit, now arouse it. Wait a few years til that Fred guy grew balls, then a few more waiting for puberty. Replace the band with guys who knew what they were doing. Add a touch of a reggae backdrop, a drunken groove, a smoke, and you’ve got San Diego’s hottest band…EVER…MIX MOB. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mix+Mob\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
