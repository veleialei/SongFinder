Pretty Boy Floyd is a glam metal band that formed in 1988 in Hollywood, California. After play only eight shows, they were snapped up by MCA Records. Starting out at the tail end of the 80s' sleazy rock scene, they're best known for their 1989 debut album 'Leather Boyz with Electric Toyz'.\n\nNot too long ago, when a movement rose saying that rock was about having a good time, letting your hair down, and trying to create a little chaos and anarchy to have fun, four guys got together in Hollywood and formed a band. NYC guitarist Kristy Majors hooked up with west coast front man Steve Summers and laid the foundation for their dream band. They jammed, wrote songs together, and played constantly to get their sound right. The band chose the name “Pretty Boy Floyd” because it seemed to describe them well, being four teen toughs armed with guitar licks and teenage angst who set out to conquer the musical world.\t \n\nThe group signed to MCA records and released 'Leather Boyz with Electric Toyz', a 1989 album whose very name was a tongue-in-cheek tip of the hat to the group's glamorous heroes such as Kiss, the New York Dolls, and Sweet. Those previous bands had also believed that rock music wasn't just music, being part show, part spectacle, and part lifestyle (“a prostitute to be trumped up and tarted around like a band aid or cheap whore” in the words of David Bowie). The Howard Benson-produced album made a significant impact, being named one of the hottest albums of its genre by the 'Metal Edge' and 'Spin' magazines.\t \n\nPretty Boy Floyd landed on the cover of metal bible Kerrang! and their two Top 20 videos “I Wanna Be With You” and “Rock and Roll is Gonna Set the Night on Fire” hit MTV, back when MTV ran videos instead of reality shows. The band toured the world and were recognized as the kings of the Sunset Strip, breaking attendance records held by Van Halen and Warrant. Their album would go on to sell 750,000 copies worldwide.\t \n\nAs the new millennium rolled in, new music fans began to wonder what they had missed. While most Pretty Boy Floyd fans were at an age that you wouldn’t commonly associate with concert goers, a whole new breed of young fans who weren’t even out of school when the band first emerged began to rediscover their music. The original fans and the new fans meshed on their common ground - a love of Pretty Boy Floyd’s music, sleazy shows, and fun times. Never mind what the critics think, or what trends may have come and gone.\t \n\nHaving outlasted many of the critics who cried “they’ll never make it,“ Pretty Boy Floyd continues to record and tour the world. Their current lineup: Steve Summers - Vocals ~ Kristy Majors - Guitar ~ Criss 6 - Bass ~ Ben Graves - Drums\t \n\n2. Canadian hard rock/glam metal band from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada active in 1987-1990. They released Bullets & Lipstik EP in 1988 and Bullets & Lipstik LP in 1989. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pretty+Boy+Floyd\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
