The debut album called \"Terast mis hangund me hinge\" (Steel Frozen in Our Souls) was released at that time.\n\nIn 2000, a good friend Lauri \"Varulven\" Õunapuu joined the band. Until then, he had observed the activities of the band with a broad smile and had, from time to time, joined them on stage. Varulven had self-taught himself a number of ancient Estonian folk instruments and together they realised that metal and old Estonian folk fit together perfectly. Since then, the music of Metsatöll has interwined more and more with old Estonian runo-singing and traditional melodies.\n\nIn 2000, their bass virtuoso Andrus left the band due to personal reasons. However, he was replaced with a new bass player, Raivo \"KuriRaivo\" Piirsalu, in just a couple of months. \n\nIn 2002, Metsatöll contributed to the Estonian music scene with their newest effort, \"Hundi Loomine\", for which a video was also shot (directed by Liina Paakspuu). \"Hundi Loomine\" received numerous exceptionally positive reviews and commentaries in the local media, there was talk of the true mind of the Estonians, the destruction of the negative effects of the English language and the rebirth of folklore through contemporary means and people. \n\nIn the beginning of 2004, Factor dedicated himself completely to science and was replaced by Marko Atso.\n\nIn late 2004, Metsatöll released their sophomore album, called \"Hiiekoda\" (My Home, My Sacred Grove), which was critically acclaimed by both metal and non-metal fans from all over Estonia. It is a heavy metal album strongly combined with old Estonian traditional instruments.\n\nIn 2005, Metsatöll released a re-recording of their first album \"Terast mis hangund me hinge\" called \"Terast mis hangund me hinge 10218\". The number stands for the world's age according to Estonian chronology. It is much more influenced by folk music and done in a much more professional way in general. It is a must-have for any Metsatöll's listener.\n\nIn 2008, Metsatöll released a single \"Veelind\" from their then upcoming album, \"Iivakivi\". They also signed with Spinefarm Records.\n\nConsidered a highly popular band in their home country, they have also won many competitions.\n\n\"Metsatöll\" pretty much means \"wolf\". It was believed among Estonians that the name of the wolf cannot be said out loud, and that whenever you say \"wolf\", it will appear. For that reason, wolves were called by various different names, such as võsavillem, vanatöll, hallivatt, metsaisand, metsakutsu, hallivatimees, etc. One of the names was metsatöll, which roughly translates into \"forest creature\" (mets - forest; töll - being, creature).\n\nTheir official website is www.metsatoll.ee <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Metsat%C3%B6ll\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
