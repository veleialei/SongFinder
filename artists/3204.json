Here are some Myspace links to these different bands:\n\n1.) Storyville\nBlues / Rock\nAUSTIN, Texas\nhttp://www.myspace.com/storyvilleaustintx\n\nStoryville, founded 1994 in Austin, Texas had decided to call it quits in 1998 after five years together as a band. The relatively short amount of time they spend on stage was offset by the travel, late nights, and time away from their families. The members of the band Chris Layton (drums), Tommy Shannon (bass, both from Double Trouble, Stevie Ray Vaughan's ex-band), David Holt (guitar), David Grissom (guitar), and Malford Milligan (vocals) were leaving on good terms with each other and their fans.\n\nStoryville has released four recordings, the first was Bluest Eyes, and the credits show that the band had not quite formed at the time it was made. Their second release and their most commercially successful effort was A Piece Of Your Soul, which contains the popular song Good Day for the Blues. The last studio recording was Dog Years, and many songs from it were getting frequent air play on the radio. The band also released the double live CD plus DVD Live at Antones with two new studio tracks in 2007 which was recorded at Antone's club in Austin in January 2006.\n\n2.) storyville - \"storyville 06\"\nAcoustic\nUK\nwww.myspace.com/storyville06\n\nDiscography:\nFarewell To Storyville\n\n3.)
