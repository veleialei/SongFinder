Musically, their sound is fresh and experimental – pulsing drums, angular guitars and expansive production with flourishes of electronic undertones – but spiritually they are voices to those around them, passionate advocates of boundless and unhindered worship.\n\nFrontman Omega Levine and Drummer/Producer Sam de Jong formed New Zealand’s Parachute Band in 2007, picking up from where the original Parachute Band (1996-2006) had left off. Already, the band has toured relentlessly throughout America, Africa, Asia, the UK and Europe.\n\nNow in their fifth year as a unit, the band stands on a strong line-up of four albums: ROADMAPS & REVELATIONS, TECHNICOLOR, LOVE WITHOUT MEASURE and their latest, MATINS:VESPERS.\n\nTheir first self-produced effort, LOVE WITHOUT MEASURE was recognised by the New Zealand music industry in 2011, garnering a New Zealand Music Award for Best Gospel/Christian Album.\n\nFrom their inception, Parachute Band’s intent has been to take New Zealand’s leading worship songs and introduce them to the world. And these songs have travelled – Grammy Award-winning worship outfit Casting Crowns recorded a version of the band’s song ‘Mercy’ on their album UNTIL THE WORLD HEARS. The band has also found camaraderie with former Delirious? Frontman Martin Smith, who contributed guest vocals on LOVE WITHOUT MEASURE track ‘It’s You’.\n\nSmith has continued to work with the Parachute boys, recruiting them as his band for a string of dates in 2010 and 2011.\n\nThe band’s strength is in their ability to avoid the musical stereotype of their genre. They’re constantly seeking experimentation; delivering solid worship themes within songs that channel the indie fervour of Arcade Fire and the instrumental invention of Sigur Ros and Bon Iver. This kind of crossover chemistry saw the band take out the People’s Choice Award at the mainstream 2008 NZ Music Awards. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Parachute+Band\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
