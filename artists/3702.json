Their latest album, V, was released on September 30, 2016. \n\nTheir sound has been described as classic desert rock, similar to bands like Dozer, Fu Manchu (with whom they have toured), and Kyuss. They have been featured on the MTV Sweden show \"Fuzz\"\n\nThe film Truckfighters by Joerg Steineck and Christian Maciejewski portrays the band's life. It was released in December 2011 and features interviews with Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. The film provides an ironic, entertaining view of the three \"ordinary\" guys who transform into Fuzz Monsters onstage.\n\nCurrent Line Up\n    * Ozo (Oskar Cedermalm) - vocals and bass\n    * Dango (Niklas Källgren) - guitar\n    * Enzo (Axel Larsson) - drums\n\nDiscography\nAlbums: Gravity X (2005)Phi (2007)Mania (2009)Universe (2014)V (2016)\n\nEPs: Desert Cruiser EP (2001)Truckfighters vs. Firestone (2003)Truckfighters do Square (2004)Hidden Treasures of Fuzz (2011)The Chairman EP (2013) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Truckfighters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
