With a fascination for ryhthms and textutes, he welds his own work together by sampling and resampling many of his own performances on bass, guitar, trombone, dan tu whilst layering his own programmed sounds and distortions. \nTwo albums \"can the mechanical be beautiful...?\" (2001) and \" ...and a crescent half lit the sky\" (2003) were released to critical acclaim and after becoming a regular on the Melbourne leftfield electronic scene alongside artists such as Pretty Boy Crossover, High Pass Filter and Ben Frost Nightswimmer suddenly disappeared from Melbourne in 2004. He headed to Tokyo with his other project- The Sound Movement. Some of the early The Sound Movement material was evolved into dark pop from Nightswimmer experimentations. TSM moved onto Manchester and now London where Day has lived since January 2005. \nDuring that 2001-2003 period there were two other significant recordings which were unreleased due to the turmoil of travel performing and relocating \nThe first is titled \"Glass Painting With Sun\" after the Kandinsky painting which was written and recorded in an intense flurry of activity immediately after the painstaking detail of \"Can The Mechanical..\" \nThe Second was an untitled EP collaboration with London's highly respected sound artist Scanner- from one side of the globe to another a truly international, mail-and-play-with collaboration that took place long before the ease of internet broadband file swapping. \n\nNow in 2009, for the first time ever, the entire Nightswimmer catalogue is about to be released online through the London Based label \"Shifting Sounds\" \n\n\"nightswimmer\" (1999)\n\"can the mechanical be beautiful...?\"(2001)\n\"glass painting with sun\" (2001)\n\"untitled\" nightswimmer with scanner( 2002)\n\"...and a crescent half lit the sky\"2003)\n\nThe new long awaited nightswimmer album will be released in the second half of 2009...stay tuned for details.... \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nightswimmer\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
