He discovered a singing voice at a young age and recorded a few minor successes with several small record labels under the stage name, Johnny Jordan, Dick Bush, and Johnny Faire, the latter gaining some note for the Top 100 hit, Bertha Lou. Encouraged by friends, Dorsey and Johnny Burnette, he persevered in the music business and in 1959 made his first recording using the name Donny Brooks. Called Lil' Sweetheart it received a lukewarm reception but his 1960 single Mission Bell demonstrated a quality voice in an upbeat song that made it to No.7 on the Billboard chart.\n\nHis follow-up, Doll House peaked at No.31 and although he continued to record through to the 1970s, he never again achieved the same level of success. In 1971, Brooks played the role of Christ in the rock opera \"Truth of Truths\". A born-again Christian, in recent years he has toured with other performers from the early rock and roll era in oldies revival shows.\n\nFor his pioneering contribution to the genre, Donnie Brooks has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Donnie+Brooks\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
