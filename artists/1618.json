After Robinson left, Livin' Joy scored more hits during the 1995-1996 period with another singer. However, the biggest remains 'Dreamer', a huge international hit reaching number 1 in the UK and the top 10 in many other European countries. Robinson had previously worked with the Livin' Joy producers on 2 singles, Children and Sweetest Day of May. On the Livin' Joy album Don't Stop Movin, her vocals do not appear on any tracklisted songs, until the original Dreamer appears as a hidden track at the very end. Her subsequent solo debut album The Color Within Me was an earthy, more singer/songwriter Pop/Rock type album and was released in 1999 to largely favourable reviews, scoring a minor pop hit with the single \"Nothing I Would Change\". In 2000, Janice performed on the WB supernatural drama Charmed, in the episode \"Animal Pragmatism\".\nIn 2000, she toured America as an opening act for Tina Turner's U.S. leg of her world tour. Her biggest hit with Livin' Joy was reissued with new music, vocals and Janice was credited for her work on it this time. \"Dreamer '05\" became a massive hit with fans & DJ's alike making the Top five of the Hot Dance Music/Club Play char t. Her dance single, \"Earthbeat\" is featured on the compilation Pride 1998 mixed/produced by Julian Marsh. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Janice+Robinson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
