After releasing some EPs and singles, all of which received praise for their incredible energy and live feeling, the group released their debut album on Sympathy for the Record Industry, Live! In the Bed. Touring continued for the group, including stops in Europe, Japan, and Australia. In 2001, the band released Can You Do the Nose Mustache?, another EP. This was prior to an August release of 14 Frenzied Shakers, their sophomore effort on Sympathy. The band has performed at several musical showcases in Canada and the United States, and has toured with the Deadly Snakes, the Von Bondies, and the Detroit Cobras among others. A collection of their numerous seven-inch releases, 28 Party Dancers from Montreal's Finest, was released by Sympathy in 2005. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Les+Sexareenos\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
