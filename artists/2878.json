He joined The Adolescents in 1980. His guitar style and writing domintated the legendary Blue Album on Frontier Records. In a precursor of things to come, Agnew left the band soon after its release in 1981, due to personal and creative differences. Replacing Agnew briefly was Pat Smear from The Germs who later played guitar in Nirvana and Foo Fighters. Agnew released his first solo album, All By Myself, on which he plays all the instruments. He was briefly in the band Christian Death and released Only Theatre of Pain. He joined D.I. in 1983, with Casey Royer and younger brother Alfie Agnew until 1986. When The Adolescents reunited together in 1986, Agnew rejoined the band until its demise in 1989. Agnew went on to release two more solo albums, Rikk Agnew's Yard Sale and Turtle. In 2000, Agnew again regrouped with The Adolescents and continued to play with them until 2003. Agnew also toured with the reunited 45 Grave, in place of original guitarist Paul Cutler, in 2004 and 2005. He currently plays guitar in PooP with Scott Hoogland, former front-man of the influential Orange County, California, band The Mechanics. Agnew also plays in the reunited Detours. Rikk Agnew is now playing in Christian Death 1334 with James McGearty and EVA O. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rikk+Agnew\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
