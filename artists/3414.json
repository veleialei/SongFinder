They got their start in the early 50s as the Five Pennies, eventually becoming (with a number of personnel changes along the way) the Chimes, and the 4 Jokers, evolving into the Four Pennies in the early 60s.\nOne of the group’s early members was none other than Clifford Curry, who recorded a number of cool soul 45s in the 60s including ‘She Shot a Hole In My Soul’.\nThey recorded two 45s for Brunswick in 1967, with ‘You’re a Gas With Your Trash’ coming out first.\nThe Four Pennies would eventually evolve into the Hearts of Stone, recording an album for the Motown subsidiary VIP in the early 70s.\n\n2. The Four Pennies were an English, 1960s pop group.\nTheir biggest success Stateside, was with their song \"Black Girl\", which was a traditional United States folk song, and brought out in 1964. However, in their homeland the group was more famous for having a Number one hit in the UK Singles Chart in the same year, with \"Juliet\". Initially, their self penned ballad was only intended to be released as a \"B\" side. Interestingly, it was the only 1964 Number one by a UK group not to chart in America. They finally folded in 1966, when their last single release \"No More Sad Songs For Me\", failed to chart.\nThe group's 1965 hit, \"Until It's Time For You To Go\", written by Buffy Sainte-Marie, was recorded by Elvis Presley in 1972.\n\n3. The Four Pennies were actually The Chiffons under an assumed name. They released two singles; \"My block\" / \"Dry your eyes\" which reached number 67 on the Billboard pop chart and \"When the boy's happy (the girl's happy too)\" / \"Hockaday (part 1)\" which reached number 95. The Chiffons records came out on Laurie but The Four Pennies singles came out on Laurie subsidary, Rust. Both singles were issued in the UK on Stateside but didn't trouble the charts. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Four+Pennies\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
