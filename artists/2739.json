Planetakis are hedonists who like to get totally trashed in their favourite discotheque without worrying about next days evil hangover.\n\nTheir punkadelic-energetic on-stage performance is notorious for giving the audience an uber-adrenalin kick full of positive aggression. They will rock the shack next door as well as large crowds. They gave proof by opening for acts like babyshambles, art brut and we are scientists.\n\nThe people behind Planetakis are already popular from their bands: Robert Drakogiannakis (voice and guitar) is known as frontman and main songwriter of the successful german alternative band Angelika Express. Jenny Fey (voice and keyboards) is the charismatic singer of the hardcorepunkband Inner Conflict. Besides music she is a professional actress as well. They are located in Cologne, a city with a international reputation for Minmalelectronic (Kompakt), Krautrock (Can) and its orgiastic carnival.\nTheir debut album \"Beautiful Today\" is released via Crafty/PIAS in europe.\n\n\n(official press release, www.planetakis.de , www.myspace.com/planetakis)\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Planetakis\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
