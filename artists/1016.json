In his lyrics, the character is portrayed as an Indian taxi driver, mystic, sitar player, chef, snake charmer and avid fan of elephant racing. He appears clad in traditional Indian garb, such as a kurta and pagri, with the addition of dark glasses that are also worn by the other characters portrayed by Jakobsen. Subsequently, he went on to record albums as faux-Scottish Dr. MacDoo and faux-Mexican Carlito. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Bombay\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
