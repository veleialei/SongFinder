His father was a stage actor, and Green fell in love with the musicals his father acted in.\n\nGreen began his musical career when he was 18 and in college at Texas Tech in Lubbock. \"I started playing guitar to pick up the chicks,\" Green laughs. \"Before that, I only sang in the shower. I could mimic other people's voices. It took me a long time to find my own voice, but once I did, I became very comfortable with it. It's not real pretty but it's believable.\"\n\nDuring those college years, Green started playing clubs and opening shows for other artists. In 1995, he put out his first independent record.\n\n\"I don't know exactly where it began, if it was Willie Nelson's picnic or one of Jerry Jeff's shows, but I got asked to play and there was a huge crowd there,\" Green says. \"After that show, we started getting some radio support. All of a sudden, everything started happening at once. We were selling a ton of records. We were able sell out Billy Bob's. In Dallas-Fort Worth, we were selling 4, 5, 6000 seats. In Houston and everywhere else, it started being 1000, 2000 seats. It just started steamrolling. I think it was a combination of the popularity of Robert Earl Keen, Jerry Jeff Walker and Willie Nelson leading the forefront for us little guys. We just all fell in line behind them.\"\n\nThe result of that faith was Green's 2001 major-label debut, Three Days, on Republic/Universal. The album Wave On Wave followed in 2003, and debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard country albums chart, and the title track cracked the Top 5 on the singles chart. He released Lucky Ones in 2004. In 2006, after a move to the RCA imprint BNA, he issued Cannonball.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pat+Green\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
