He has performed and recorded as a session musician with many important jazz, classical, and popular artists. He has also performed and recorded with his own jazz group and has released solo albums. He joined the faculty at the University of Washington in 1980.\n\nCollier grew up in Seattle, Washington. Collier made his first public appearance in Puyallup, Washington on April 2, 1954 at age 5 on the xylophone. His first professional performances were at age 9 as a marimba player, and then at age 13 he appeared on The Lawrence Welk Show.\n\nWith the emergence of rock and roll as the dominant musical force in America, the young Collier was exposed to music that would have a lasting impact on his career. As a teenager growing up in Seattle, he enjoyed the music of The Wailers (rock band), a Tacoma, Washington-based rock band considered by many to be the first garage rock group. Collier was especially fond of their song \"Dirty Robber\".\n\nCollier has been director of percussion studies at the University of Washington since 1980. In 1991, Collier released his instrumental album Pacific Aire, in which he collaborated with Bud Shank on alto saxophone and flute and Don Grusin (Dave Grusin's brother) on keyboards. Jazz writer Scott Yanow appreciated the level of musicianship evident in the album, but he criticized the music as \"lightweight...as if no one is taking any real chances.\" He continued that \"Collier's eight originals are pleasing if not memorable, and there is no stretching taking place.\" Collier's job at the University of Washington has also allowed him the chance to connect with a younger generation of college students in his \"American Popular Song\" class.\n\nThe year 2004 saw the release of Collier's album Mallet Jazz, another instrumental showcase in which he is joined by fellow session musicians from throughout his career, such as percussion hall-of-famer Emil Richards on marimba, Joe Porcaro and John Bishop on drums, and Mike Lang and Don Grusin on piano. Dave Brubeck's old clarinetist Bill Smith also appears on clarinet in \"Mutso Futso in Row 12.\" Longtime Collier friend and collaborator Dan Dean plays bass on all tracks. Collier plays vibes for most of the album, but occasionally joins Richards on marimba. Collier composed all the songs for this album. Critic Adam Greenberg wrote of the album, \"The intricate lines devised by Collier show off the abilities of the lead duo [Collier and Richards], and the solos taken by both Collier and Richards alone make the album worth hearing.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Collier\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
