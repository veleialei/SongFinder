Greg Serpa (Bass/Vocals), David Duhig (Guitar/Vocals/Sax) and Mia Thompson (Keyboard, Bass) met at SFSU's film department, where they started playing music together in the sound effects room. In need of a drummer Greg recruited Leva Schneider, and as a result The Weegs were born. \n\nDuring their career, Weegs put out 2 full length albums on New York label, Hungry Eye Records: Meat The Weegs (2004) and The Million Sounds of Black (2006).  They also have singles on two compilations, Golden Grouper Vol. 1 (2004-Gold Standard Laboratories) and Oakland: The Secret Is Out  (2004-Warm and Fuzzy). Ricardo Esway recorded and mixed all Weegs music. He is known in some circles as \"The 5th Weeg\". The Weegs toured the west coast twice (2004 &2005) and Europe once (2006). \n\nIn late 2005 due to irreconcilable differences, guitarist David Weeg split from the band. Jason Stamberger, of former SF Electronic band Crack We Are Rock,  joined on guitar for the European Tour. Two unreleased songs, \"Rotten Ovum\" and \"Addiction is Fun\" were recorded with guitarist Jason Weeg.  After returning to the U.S from their one month European Tour, The Weegs had one unplanned final show August, 2006 at The Knockout in San Francisco, with Ray Day on guitar (member of former LA band The Centimeters). \n\n\"Dave, Leva, Greg, and Mia share 'Weeg' as their surname and play like a 1981 New York no wave band that could have been a legend in their own time. In the sweaty, curtained confines of the Hemlock Tavern, they channeled the Addams family by way of Captain Beefheart, creating an organ-heavy clamor. Next to their jerkily sexy rendition of Prince's 'Controversy,' the high point of the evening occurred when Dave Weeg assaulted his guitar with that venerable hipster's club card, the studded belt, summoning that 'wall of noise' everyone likes to talk about. Whether he meant to make a statement or not, it was crafty.\" --SF Bay Guardian\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Weegs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
