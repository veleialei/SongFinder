They are best known for their single \"When I'm Gone (Sadie)\" (#11 - Mainstream Rock Tracks, #21 - Modern Rock Tracks). On May 18th, 2007, melodic.net posted an article about lead singer Ben Lauren's future solo album under the Indegoot Entertainment umbrella.\n\nThe band announced their breakup on Wednesday, September 06, 2006 in a MySpace blog with the headline \"The End\". Here is the posted blurb: \"I wish that I could be more specific about what happened. It's a long story and it doesn't matter anyhow. What matters is that the old makes way for the new. We are all still doing music in some capacity, some of us are together and some of us aren't. Bands break up, relationships change, music takes us other places. \"Times Doesn't Notice\" and the tours in 2005 were precious memories for all of us and YOU made that happen for No Address. Thanks so much for giving us such great experiences.\"\n\nBut on June 21, 2007 the band cryptically announced a possible reunion in a MySpace blog with the headline \"The New Old No Address Record: Let It Out.\" The blog hints that a new record may be in the bands future. On July 13, 2007 Ben Lauren posted a bulletin on MySpace saying \"All original members are back. A new record is being recorded beginning in September. Very exciting news!\".\n\nThe current Line-up consists of:\n\n    * Ben Lauren - Vocals\n    * Justin Long - Guitar\n    * Randy Lane - Drums\n    * Bill Donaldson - Bass\n    * Phil Moreton - Guitar\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/No+Address\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
