His songs are tagged on this page.)\n\nAlthough mostly known for his productions under the aliases M.I.K.E., Push and Plastic Boy, Mike has released hundreds of records under more than eighty aliases and collaborations since 1992 in a wide variety of styles ranging from rave, techno, progressive house, trance, electro to even R&B, from accessible commercial anthems to minimalist underground sounds. He also produced tracks for Yves DeRuyter, Marco Bailey,Armin Van Buuren, Ian Van Dahl and Diabokua. \n\nAt the age of 18, Mike handed his first demo tape to the Antwerp record company USA Import Music and released his first record as Vision Act. In 1996 he signed with Lightning Records (the parent company of Bonzai Records) where he worked with most of its artists and achieved his major commercial breakthrough in 1998 with the trance anthem \"Universal Nation\" under his Push guise, one of the best selling dance vinyls of all time which even ended up in mainstream singles charts all over the world. This was followed up by two more chart hits, \"Strange World\" and \"The Legacy\". \n\n As the list continued, creating such hits brought on major appeal by huge names like  Moby, Ferry Corsten, Armin van Buuren, Gareth Emery and so much more - which of whom M.I.K.E produced impressive collaborations and remixes for.\n As time passed and M.I.K.E.'s name spread, popular demand began to expand rapidly worldwide! From the UK, to cities all around Europe & straight across the Atlantic &  into North America and down Latin America,  Asia and Australia - Ministry of Sound, DanceValley, Tomorrowland, Trance Energy, Winter Music Conference - were some of the prestigious venues that till this day M.I.K.E. is  noticed for as a top leading performer/DJ. \n And we wonder, where does he find the time to make so many hit releases?  Through the wave of fans, the touring, atmosphere and passion for music are what tell the stories behind each of his exceptional tracks  labeled under monikers Push, Plastic boy, to his most widely used name - M.I.K.E. \n And now teaming up with labels such as Sirup Music, High Contrast Records, Garuda Music, and Armada Music, he continues introducing fresh new sounds with edge & a twist of progressive and club house for a totally modish blend. You can grab a taste on his weekly radio show 'Club Elite Sessions', also heard on various stations worldwide including SiriusXM and Digitally Imported Radio . \n Check out www.mike.be  for more updates, news, releases, links  and touring info for a chance to experience a majestic adventure! <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/M.I.K.E.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
