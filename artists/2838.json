After the single \"Sell Out\" began breaking into the mainstream, including MTV, the album made an appearance on the charts. The ska revival was short-lived, however, and \"Why Do They Rock So Hard?\" (1998) did not lead the group to the mainstream.\n\nReel Big Fish released \"Cheer Up\" (2002) which began a movement into harder rock and pop sounds, with much less ska than the previous albums. The song \"Where Have You Been?\" was aimed at a wider audience, trying to drop the less popular ska sound, but was met with little mainstream success, despite the video. Their second most recent studio album was \"We're Not Happy Until You're Not Happy\" (2005).\n\nThey recently released \"Our Live Album is Better Than Your Live Album\" (2006) which includes 2 discs worth or their own tunes and a few covers of popular songs along with a DVD. They have worked on the soundtrack to BASEketball, which included a cover of A-Ha's Take On Me.\n\nIn 2006, they split from Jive records, who produced a \"Best of\" album against the will of the band, who could not prevent the release. The band has made a campaign to try and stop people buying the album.\n\nTheir latest album, \"Monkeys For Nothing and the Chimps For Free\" (2007) includes some songs that were previously recorded and released on other albums.\n\nIn 2009, they released \"Fame, Fortune, and Fornication\" an album composed of covers of older songs, including \"Won't Back Down\" by Tom Petty, and \"Nothin' But a Good Time\" by Poison.\n\nCurrent members:\n\nAaron Barrett - guitar, lead vocals (1992–present)\nDan Regan - trombone, backing vocals (1994–present)\nJohn Christianson - trumpet, backing vocals (2004–present)\nRyland Steen - drums (2005–present)\nDerek Gibbs - bass guitar (2007–present)\n\nPast members:\n\nBen Guzman - vocals (1992–1994)\nZach Gilltrap - keyboards/synthesizers (1992–1994)\nLisa Smith - guitar (1992–1994)\nEric Vismantes - trumpet (1994)\nStephan Reed - saxophone (1994)\nRobert Quimby - trombone (1994–1995)\nAdam Polakoff - saxophone (1994–1995)\nGrant Barry - trombone (1995–1998)\nAndrew Gonzales - drums (1992–1998)\nTavis Werts - trumpet (1994–2001)\nCarlos de la Garza - drums (1999–2003)\nTyler Jones - trumpet (2001–2004)\nJustin Ferreira - drums (2003–2005)\nMatt Wong - bass, backing vocals (1992–2007)\nScott Klopfenstein - trumpet, guitar, keyboards, backing vocals (1995–2011) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Reel+Big+Fish\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
