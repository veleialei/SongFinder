After an initial discussion in a Melbourne hotel about a band concept, guitarist / keyboardist / vocalist Elroy Falcon, bass player Charlie Lima and drummer Sven Grinner began recording songs, including one about ABC Newsreader Rosemary Church. After hearing the song, Rosemary sent the band a personally autographed photo and letter of appreciation.\n\nFollowing this, the song-writing snowballed and by writing 12 songs in a fortnight, the band then flew off to their birthplace Tasmania for their first gigs. This first tour nearly became their last! Flying into Launceston on a 6-seater prop in thick fog, the pilot aborted the landing 3 times, nearly stalling the plane on the last attempt. After finally landing 100km away in fog-free Devonport, the band boarded a mini-bus back to Launceston, only to be scared shitless again by a crazy bus driver going maximum speed through that same life threatening fog!\n\nThankfully they survived, and the ensuing gigs were a breeze. Following more recording, In 1996 their self-funded debut EP 'Bainmarie Dream in Polychrome' was released, gaining airplay on Sydney and Melbourne stations. Following a short tour to Sydney, Melbourne independent label Rubber Records signed the band, and during December Oscarlima began recording their next EP.\n\n'Charismacola' was the five-track EP that resulted. Released in mid 1997, the EP's sound saw the band branch out stylistically, encompassing psychedelia on 'Who are we'' and a soulful groove on 'Mother'. \n\nSpending the good part of 1998 in Sven's backyard shed new writing songs, an investment in a keyboard allowed the band to incorporate different instruments into the songwriting. Vibraphone, glockenspiel, hammond organ, trumpet 1980's drum machines are some of the new sounds in Oscarlima songs.\n\nThe working title for the debut album is 'Desert Caravan' - titled after a tune about a lonely cowboy pining for his cowgirl. The first single 'Bare Hands' was followed by the new single 'If you wanna be my friend' 1999. \n\nCourtesy rubber records <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Oscarlima\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
