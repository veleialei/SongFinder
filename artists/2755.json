This article is about the Swiss band of the same name\n\nPortobello is an indie rock band from Lucerne (Switzerland) born of singer, guitarist and songwriter Markus Burri. With Christian Bucher (drums) and Roger Huerlimann (bass) an exciting sound-entity emerges, full of energetic guitar-driven songs.\n\nIn 2004 Portobello released their debut album Face the Music, which appeared through Helvetic Production and 11 p.m. records. The band was pleased with various outstanding reviews in magazines and newspapers. In order to promote the album, Portobello  played several shows in renowned clubs such as Schuur in Lucerne (with Nada Surf), Albani in Winterthur, Grabenhalle in St.Gallen, Abart Zürich (with Matt Costa) and the Suedbahnhof in Chemnitz (Germany). Banana Pirates Records, a label from Mannheim (Germany), released then a compilation called “Audio Surf\", on which Portobello with She's Like Night appeared as the only Swiss band. They later played seven shows throughout Germany from Frankfurt to Berlin.\n\nIn the meantime the band started recording their new album at the Metronom-Studio in Basel over the period of one and a half years with Philippe Laffer for “Taktvoll-Musik”. Just for the beginning of 2007, the band’s second album My head is my pillow is my head is on the way with 11 great multi-faceted indie-rock-style songs. All songs carry the writing of Markus Burri… pure and honest Portobello – a tantalising, powerful, yet fragile sound collage with a hint of pop-appeal. The album is produced by Philippe Laffer and co-produced by Markus Burri. The album comes with a peculiar cover-art in combination with the video for Playing Dead which is featured within the same location. With Condor Records, Portobello signed to a young and innovative label to release the new album.\n\nThe Band was pleased with a great start: Playing Dead  was mx3-Song of the week on Suisse National Radio DRS3 and the videoclip for the song is rotating on different Stations in Switzerland and Germany.\n\nCurrently the band is working on their third studio album. The Release of the the new album is planned for autumn 2009.\n\nhttp://www.portobello-music.ch/\nhttp://www.myspace.com/portobelloband/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Portobello\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
