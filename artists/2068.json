Her mother Simone was a shorthand typist and father, a truck driver during the week, who played trumpet on the weekends in a local brass band. She showed the first signs of her talent in the primary school, when at the age of 7 she won an amateur competition.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Jacqueline’s father was mobilised, spending five years away from the family.

Her grandmother had a cafe in Armentières, where she used to sing for the passing soldiers.\n\nShe auditioned at Conservatoire de Lille, singing songs written by Loulou Gasté “Sainte-Madeleine” and “Mon âme au diable”. Louis Gasté was at that time a well known French composer. At the end of the audition, she was approached by then director of the Radio Lille who was looking for a singer. She took pseudonym Jacqueline Ray and joined the station singing a repertoire based on the songs by Loulou Gasté. In 1945, she moved to Paris and got her first gig in Folies Belleville, where she was introduced to Gasté. She was 16, Gasté was 37.
