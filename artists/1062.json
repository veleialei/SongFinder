He was soon able to play a variety of instruments though he was most accomplished on the trumpet. After World War II, he graduated from playing as an amateur in brass bands to professional engagements with popular dance orchestras of the day including that of Geraldo, and he soon became renowned for the virtuosity of his performances. Following his exposure on TV with the Stanley Black Orchestra, an enthusiastic announcer introduced him as the 'Man With The Golden Trumpet' - an apt description that remained with him for the remainder of his musical career.\n\nEddie's style was unusually individualistic, and he became a familiar musician on BBC radio and TV during the 1950s. He started to make records for the Columbia label and his popularity can be assessed from the success of his records, which included two UK number ones, 'Oh Mein Papa', followed more than a year later by 'Cherry Pink And Apple Blossom White'. He was thus the first British instrumentalist to achieve two number ones. The magnificent 'Oh Mein Papa', which also sold well in the USA, topped the UK singles chart for no less than nine weeks (a British chart record}, and was successful enough to provide him with the first ever 'gold disc' awarded for an UK instrumental track.\n\nFurther chart entries were secured with 'John And Julie', taken from the soundtrack of the movie; plus 'Mandy', Eddie's last major hit. Other recordings include 'Stranger In Paradise' in 1955; 'The Man with the Golden Arm' in 1956; and 'Jealousy' in 1960.\n\nAs the music scene entered the less innocent age of the 1960s, Eddie's beautiful musical renditions became less appreciated by record buyers. By 1968 Eddie had become a little disillusioned by his dwindling fortunes and left Britain, making South Africa his home.\n\nEddie died in 1978 aged 56.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eddie+Calvert\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
