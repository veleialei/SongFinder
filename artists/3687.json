One of the best-unknown bands in the hard rock genre, but lack of label support killed any chance the band had for massive success. \n  Formed in Memphis, Tennessee, by Anthony Corder (vocals), Keith Douglas (guitar), Patrick Francis (drums) and John Patterson (drums). They quickly beat out sixty other groups in a Battle of the Bands contest and received some free studio time. They cut one track in Memphis before using the prize money they had won to record an entire independent EP called To Rock, To Roll. The studio was so impressed with the recordings that they offered to help shop the demo and gave them even more free recording time. Tora Tora eventually singed with A&M and the debut album made the Billboard Top 100, and hovered on the brink of breaking wide open. Later that same year \"Dancing With A Gypsy\" would appear on the soundtrack for Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. The follow-up, while being another classic, sold even less copies then the debut. A third album was recorded but never released due to label restructuring. Realizing that their due date had expired, the band folded. \n  Recent years have seen Corder and Francis perform live as either Tora Tora or Homemade Flavor. Rumors circulate that the unreleased third album may finally see the light of day, and one can only hope. A band that should regroup and release another killer album on the unsuspecting public. \n\n2) Were an 80's Synthpop act from France. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tora+Tora\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
