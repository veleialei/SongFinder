A American Hip Hop group.\n\n2. A Japanese instrumental latin jazz-fusion group.\n\n\n1. The Beatnuts are a hip hop group and production duo from Queens, New York City. Its current members are JuJu and Psycho Les. JuJu (born Jerry Tineo on December 4, 1968) is Dominican American from Corona and Psycho Les (born Lester Fernandez on April 10, 1972) is a Colombian American from Jackson Heights. The Beatnuts were originally a trio before Kool Fashion, now known as Al' Tariq, left the group to start a solo career. The Mighty V.I.C. (Groove Merchantz, Ghetto Pros) was also a member of The Beatnuts' production team for a while.\n\nEarly on in their career they produced whole albums for Posse members Common Sense and Chi-Ali. Their production is noted as some of the finest and most accomplished, if unheralded, in all of hip-hop, often intricately detailed (as in their finely honed work for Mos Def on two tracks from Black on Both Sides) but more regularly barnstorming, club-friendly, flourish-laden party music. Jennifer Lopez used their track \"Watch Out Now\" as the instrumental for her song \"Jenny from the Block\". The Beatnuts produced more songs for the artists they had previously collaborated with as well as Fat Joe, SuprÃªme NTM and Da Youngsta's. At the same time, The Beatnuts made their name as remix specialists by remixing songs for MC Lyte, Da Lench Mob, Naughty by Nature, Jomanda and others.\n\nThe Beatnuts are noted for being unabashedly, bullishly ribald and in-your-face performers. Recent Beatnuts albums are characterised by more Latin influences.\n\nLess known is they are considered part of the Native Tongues collective. The Beatnuts are the only Latino members of the Native Tongues collective. Although only peripheral members, they are routinely acknowledged by Q-Tip. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatnuts\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
