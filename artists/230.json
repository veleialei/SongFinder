Forging an aesthetic they dubbed \"forest music\" -- a sound created with acoustic instruments and Tibetan instruments -- the members of Atman divided their time between performing and offering workshops in instrument building and forestry, finally releasing the cassette ...jak rozrzucone po ziemi kamienie... on their own FLY (Freak Living Yourself) label in 1991. Cassettes including Soundreams and Gadajaca Laka followed before Atman made its American debut with the Drunken Fish EP Save the Earth; other efforts for the label include 1997's Personal Forest and 1999's Tradition.\n\n\nThe Spanish black metal band ATMAN:\n\nConsisted of only 2 members (Darshan – instruments, vocals, Damastor - drums), was established back in 1992 in Barcelona, Spain/Catalunia.\n\n1996 welcomes the debut album Like Pure Unawaited Magic (recorded in 1994!).\n\n13 years later, this is the 4th full-length of this mystical duo, bringing magickal black metal which stands far from the actual underground movements, trends. Hard to compare to other (black metal) bands, ATMAN can be best described as solid black metal with lyrics oriented to vedic philosophy & magick.\n\nExpect uncompromising & raw, but melancholic black metal at a mostly straight-forward tempo filled with several acoustic interludes. \n\nL'Assassí de Venus was released on vinyl in December 2008 by Ishtadeva Vinyl Productions, being edited on CD only in 2009 under license from IVP. \n\n\nDiscography:\n\n\nLike Pure Unawaited Magic - 1996\nPsy Atman - 2001\nDjirli Ika - 2005\nL'Assassí de Venus - 2008/2009 (vinyl/CD)\n\n\nAtman (Ambient World Music)\n\nThe Brazilian Atman makes a music opposite to that of the Spanish band. They combine traditional Indian instrumentation and chants with modern electronica. In 2004, they released the double remix album India Club & Lounge, which featured Atman songs remixed by artists such as Aaron Ackerson\n\nThe seeds for the Atman project were sown in 1996, when the artist was deeply involved with Yoga practice and philosophy\nThe idea of adding music to the vocal mantras used during his practice was born out of a desire to share his love for this Indian tradition\n\nProduced independently with few resources, the first album was ready on early 1997. In July 1997 Eternal Dance is released under MCD World Music.\nOn early 1998, launches Eternal Dance II, co-produced by Marcelo Gallo\n\nBy the end of the year the same album is released on Europe under Amiata Records.\n\nThe good acceptance of the first two albums in Brazil as well as overseas allows, and demands, a reengineering of both professional and personal life for the artist.\n\nDuring this transition period, he researches deeply into the works of Joseph Campbell and starts developing what would become the next two Atman albums\n\n2002 saw the debut of The Lonely Road, first installment of the project that translates to music each step on the hero-journey as described by Campbell in his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces. A year later, The Traveler hits retail as the second and last part of the project.\n\nExperiments with fractal and ambient music produced the double CD Darkness & Light under the Sonic Mandalas nom de guerre in early 2004.\n\nA few months later a collection of 25 remixes done by artists from all over the world through a remix contest based on the internet is released as India Club & Lounge.\n\nA collection of loungy tracks featuring soul, jazz, brazilian and indian influences is released as Chocolate Deluxe using the Taylor M. moniker before the end of the same year. \n\n(Source: http://www.atmanmusic.com/index.php?pag=menu&idmenu=2 )\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Atman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
