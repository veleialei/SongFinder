Their music is influenced by classic rock from the 1970s such as The Eagles and Fleetwood Mac, mixed with pop overtones and at times folk and country elements. They met at Bucknell University and formed in New York City's Greenwich Village in 1993, with sisters Cathy (guitar) and Kristen Henderson (guitar/drums) as the primary force, with Penelope \"Peppy\" Kokines taking lead vocals and Suzanne Obolsky on vocals and percussion.\n\nAs of 2009, the band consists of Kristen Henderson on bass guitar/bg vocals, Cathy Henderson on lead guitar/bg vocals, Dena Tauriello on drums and Nini Camps on rhythm guitar and lead vocals.\n\nThe band is primarily known as a touring band, at one time performing 260 shows a year. They earned a dedicated fanbase early on that follows them from concert to concert along the East Coast and increasingly across the country. Fans refer to the band simply as \"AR\" or \"Antigone\".\n\nTheir first four albums were recorded mostly with independent labels and financed through fan donations. In 2003 they signed up with Lava Records after label president Jason Flom spotted them playing at one of their gigs. In 2005, they became the first artists to be promoted in Starbucks' Hear Music Series, created to discover and spotlight new music. The high visibility, exclusive sale, in-store promotion and airplay at Starbucks across the country helped the band's acoustic EP From the Ground Up sell over 450,000 copies by the end of 2005. The album's single, \"Don't Look Back,\" was very popular among country audiences, and its video received heavy airplay on CMT.\n\nAntigone Rising have shared the stage with Joan Jett, The Rolling Stones, moe., Rob Thomas, Aerosmith, The Allman Brothers and The Bangles[1]. They performed at Lilith Fair 1998 and SXSW 2005 and have co-written with Chris Trapper of The Push Stars and Rob Thomas. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Antigone+Rising\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
