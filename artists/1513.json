Band members are Shaun Mulrooney (guitar, keys, lead vocals); Colm Rutledge (Guitar, vocals); Gary Lonergan (Bass); and Brian Gallagher (Drums, vocals).\n\nHumanzi combines guitars with dance beats and their sound shows influences spanning classic rock n roll, to Punk Rock and Dark electronic music. They cite as their main influences, Primal Scream, The Clash, Velvet Underground, Joy Division and The Stooges. Their dance background is informed by the likes of Depeche Mode, Daft Punk, Peaches and LCD Soundsystem. The Humanzi signature sound is fraught and claustrophobic, and the themes of their tracks are often heavily politicized.\n\nThey released their double A side debut single on Fiction Records, entitled ‘Fix the Cracks’ on 7th November 2005. This was followed by ‘Long Time Coming’ single release in 13th February 2005. Their latest single, ‘Diet, Pills & Magazines’ coincides with their debut album release, ‘Tremors’ which was released on 24th July 2006.\n\nTremors was recorded in the latter half of 2005 and produced by Chris Vrenna Nine Inch Nails and Gareth Mannix and co-produced by the band.\n\nTo date, they have toured with Ian Brown, The Foo Fighters, Dirty Pretty Things, Battle and White Rose Movement\n\n\nDiscography:\n\nFix The Cracks-single release -7th November 2005\n\nLong Time Coming - single release - 13th February 2006\n\nDiet, Pills & Magazines - single release - 17th July 2006\n\nTremors - debut album release - 24th July 2006 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Humanzi\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
