With the Pipers, she recorded a number of hits: \"Lily Belle\", \"Mam'selle\", \"In the Middle of May\", \"My Happiness\", and the Pipers' trademark song, \"Dream\". In 1945, she dubbed the singing voice for Vera-Ellen in the film Wonder Man.\n\nIn 1950 she left the group to become a soloist. The next year she married orchestra leader Axel Stordahl. Her recordings for Capitol Records were backed up by Stordahl's orchestra. In 1953 she had three charted hits on Capitol: \"Say You're Mine Again\", \"No Stone Unturned\", and \"For the First Time\".\n\nOn her death in 1973, at the age of 52, June Hutton was buried in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California next to her husband.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/June+Hutton\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
