They were extremely popular in the UK and had a top 10 hit with \"Banana Splits (Tra La La Song)\" in 1979; oddly enough, many of their lyrics were about aspects of Southern California life not easily decipherable to those unfamiliar with the region, in songs like \"Waterslide\", \"I'm A Chollo\", \"Manny, Moe and Jack\", and \"(I'm Stuck in a Pagoda with) Tricia Toyota\", which is about a local TV news anchorwoman.\n\nDrug problems slowed them down considerably in the 1980s, but they have continued playing and recording sporadically to the present day. In 1988 they did the theme music for the cult classic movie Killer Klowns from Outer Space.  \n\nFormer Dickies guitarist Steven Fryette, who laughingly claims to have been one of the few who \"survived\" being in The Dickies, now designs and manufactures guitar amplifiers from his FRYETTE Amplification studios in Burbank, California.  His FRYETTE (formerly VHT) amps are known worldwide, and have been used by many of today's top Heavy Metal and Rock touring acts, including Helmet, Danzig, Prong, Children Of Bodom, and many others. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Dickies\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
