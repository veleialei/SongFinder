drums and Doug on vocals. 8 weeks after getting together the band did their first gig at the Vine in Newark with about 8 of their own songs and a few Damned and UK Subs covers to fill the set , but after only 4 songs they were told to turn down or get off, they did neither 10 minutes later the landlady was in tears the promoter was soaked in his own beer, the toilets were a foot deep in water, half the P.A was in the bands van and the police were on their way.\n\n3 years of being fucked about by various drummers and singers ended up with Biff taking on the vocals, Tony join the band on second guitar and eventually a full time drummer called Paul, so now with a solid line up the Bus hit the road again and recorded a new demo, a single and a 16 track CD, but before the cd could be mixed tragedy struck when Paul suddenly died from leukemia.\n\t\nWith Wag (ex Legion of Parasites) now on drums a new record out ‘Suck on Sick on the Bus fuck heads’ they started to get noticed by the music press with favorable reviews for live and studio work, a tour of Europe with Contempt soon followed (the promoter nearly sent them home after a party just 2 days into the tour). Next was the release of ‘Punk Police’ on Data Records which came out to more good reviews a US tour, more Euro dates and the remixing of the sold out self titled cd (now called Set Fire To Someone In Authority) that came out last year (2000) and the writing of some new material.\n\nThe year 2000 also saw another mad headlining tour of Europe and the band on tour in the UK as the main support to The Damned, they ended the year in negotiations with Go Kart Records and started 2001 with a 3 album deal with them.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sick+on+the+Bus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
