The music he liked, had always differed from the mainstream. At the beginning it was hip-hop, at this stage the adventure of producing his own tracks began. In secondary school, he produced incidental music for his mates, they were in favor of his music made on PC. At the end of 1990 Tomek discovered music of the Aphex Twin and other well-known artist connected with that trend. This absorbed him in the world of electronic music, and also led to producing his own tracks. The first tracks were in an experimental style, rather agressive and noisy. Later he became interested in minimal techno, which quickly turned to hard techno and schranz. That's what is continously taking up in his tracks and live acts , which have gained recognition in Poland and abroad. Tomash has allready played in many different countries like Ukraine, Latvia, Germany, Belgium, Austria and Hungary. His first vinyl releases were in the end of 2003 on Crowbar Rec, Combat Skill, and his own label - Methadon. Now he releases on such great labels like FAK, Audio Assault ARMS or Carnage and smaller like Dark Force or FATTM and of course he continues with his label - Methadon. Soon a new sublabel of Methadon is going to be opened to release the hardest tracks.Creation of music is not the only passion of Tomek. Another one is graphics, which stands on the side because music is his main interest.You can watch his older works on www.muszaron.z.pl <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tomash+Gee\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
