Other members included: Bobby Glover, Eddie Barber, Jannetta Boyce, Jerome Derrickson, Sherman Fleetwood, Gregory Jackson & Michael Warren. This band launched the career of Shirley Murdock and, in later years, employed keyboard stylings of Ohio Players' Billy Beck. Most recognizable influence on their sound came from, original Parliament / Funkadelic vocalist, Raymon Davis.\n\nZapp is best known for its 1980 funk hit More Bounce to the Ounce (produced by Bootsy Collins). The group recorded five albums as 'Zapp' & Roger recorded five others under his own name.\n\nRoger & Zapp are known for the distinctive synthesized sound produced by recording vocals through a Talk box fed by an electonic synthesizer. Roger's voice can be heard on the Dr. Dre-produced 1996 Tupac Shakur hit \"California Love\". Roger also appeared on songs by Johnny Gill, Keith Sweat, Eric Benet and H-Town amongst others.\n\nOn Sunday, April 25, 1999, Roger Troutman was found shot and critically wounded outside a recording studio in Dayton, Ohio; he died during surgery at a local hospital. Roger's brother Larry was found dead in a car a few blocks away with a single gunshot wound to the head. It is likely that a personal dispute had developed between the two brothers; as far as can be determined, Larry shot Roger, then shot himself.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Zapp\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
