However, he is widely respected for being a multi-talented, versatile performer.\n\nDarin was a very special and talented entertainer. He was a Grammy award winning singer ('Mack The Knife'), a respected member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ('Dream Lover', 'Splish Splash', 'If I Were A Carpenter') a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, a successful record producer, an Oscar nominated actor and a strong supporter of the American Heart Association. Bobby was married to actress Sandra Dee from 1960-1967. They had one son, Dodd, born in December 1961. As a result of complications from a rheumatic heart,  Bobby's life was tragically cut short in 1973.\n\nDarin's mother, Vanina Cassotto,  had given birth to him when she was 16, and as a result, her parents raised Darin as though he were there son while Vanina was presented off as his elder sister.  Darin did not learn the truth about his parentage until he was 32.\n\nFor more on Bobby Darin, watch \"Beyond the Sea,\" in which Kevin Spacey portrays the entertainer. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+Darin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
