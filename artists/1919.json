After graduating, Kitaro moved to Tokyo to experience and become a part of the music scene, and it was there that he discovered the synthesizer. His first synthesizer was analog, and he recalls having “just loved the analog sound that it made compared to today's digital sound”.\n\nHis parents were first opposed to the idea of their son having a musical career. In an effort to maneuver him towards their vision, they made arrangements for him to take a job at a local company. In return, he left home without telling them. He supported himself by taking on several part time jobs such as cooking and civil service work, while composing songs at night.\n\nIn the early 1970s, he changed completely to keyboards. He joined the Japanese music group Far East Family Band which was formed in 1965, and toured with them around the world. While in Europe, he met the German electronica and former Tangerine Dream member Klaus Schulze. Schulze produced two albums for the band and gave Kitaro some tips for controlling synthesizers. In 1976, Kitaro left Far East Family Band and travelled through Asia (China, Laos, Thailand, India)\n\nUniversally acknowledged as the founding architect of new age music, Kitaro has achieved global acclaim over a more than three decade long career with a signature sound and a pioneering fusion of cultures, techniques and spheres of consciousness.  \n\nAs a Grammy and Golden Globe Award-winning artist, this incredibly prolific composer and performer has continued his reign in the international spotlight and at the forefront of musical innovation ever since his critically acclaimed soundtrack to the Japanese NHK documentary, Silk Road.\n  \nMost fundamentally, at its heart, Kitaro's music is always about sending a profound message of peace that has inspired countless fans from around the globe. Kitaro's latest album release, \"Sacred Journey Of Ku-Kai Volume 4\" was nominated at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards, his 14th career nomination to date.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.domomusicgroup.com/kitaro/index.php\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kitaro\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
