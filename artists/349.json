Glover was playing in Lucky Millinder's band when Bull Moose Jackson left the group in 1948; Glover suggested that Greer be chosen as Jackson's replacement. Greer played with Bob Shad and appeared on Millinder's RCA recordings until 1950, when Millinder signed to King Records. Greer stayed with RCA and played with Wynonie Harris and Jackson among others. He sang lead vocals on his biggest hit, 1952's \"Got You On My Mind\". In 1954 he switched to Groove Records, but did not make much impact on the American record charts there. In October of that year, he released \"We Want To See Santa Do The Mambo\", a Christmas hit to this day. In 1955, he finally signed with King, but only recorded for them for about a year. Greer also worked with Hal Singer and Bill Doggett.\nBy 1957, Greer had developed extended troubles with alcoholism, and he moved back to his home town of Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he died in 1972 at age 48.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Big+John+Greer\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
