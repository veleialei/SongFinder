Since their formation in 2002, Carabine and Walther's rich vocal harmonies, their sense of humour, and their appearances at Canadian music festivals has largely increased their fan base across Canada.  Both girls were raised in musical families and utilize their skills with both guitar and piano.\n\nDala released their first album in 2005, titled This Moment is a Flash.  Since then they have released two other albums, including their most recent one Who Do You Think You Are.  Their official site is: http://www.dalagirls.com/ \n\n\n\n2) Dala was the solo musical project of Dave Allison.  He started composing music in 1992.  His music is electronic and largely experimental, recalling such artists as The Black Dog, The Future Sound of London, and Autechre.  He has played live several times.  His website can be found at: http://www.hybridproductions.org/dala/ \n\nIn 2007, he changed the name to Exisonic. \n\n3) dala is a side project of musician, artist and songwriter Guy Dale. Others include his work with the band Fun√©s and Mute Swimmer. The music he produces under this moniker is largely instrumental consisting of manipulated sound drawn from concrete, electric and acoustic sources. Many of the projects involve certain conceptual contraints such as a track composed entirely from the sound of a cheap radio or the amplified static of a recording of 'nothing'. In 2005 Dala composed music for a short film entitled 'Paisaje Cero' by the spanish artist Anna Martinez Garcia. \nhttp://www.myspace.com/dalamusic\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dala\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
