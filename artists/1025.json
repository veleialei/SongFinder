Lead guitar and songwriter Abe Gross has had formal guitar training for 7 years and has reached incredible musical maturity, bringing balance with electric guitar fills as well as acoustic guitar. Peter Robbins is the bass guitar/keyboard player and songwriter for Drouz. His ingenuitive abilities for improvisation give the band a flowing sound. Peter and Abe are the principle songwriters for Drouz. Mark Fjelsted provides a solid base on acoustic guitar. Matt Heggestuen, master of the drums, adds complex, catchy beats that drive the songs home. Brendan Ellis carries the band along on his beautiful voice. Drouz's songs are vocally driven. Two and three-part harmonies are not uncommon, but often Brendan wows the audience with incredible vocal tone and control. Drouz's musical style varies from up-tempo songs such as \"1000 Puzzles\" to inspirational ballads like \"Lullaby.\" Drouz is an aural experience with a musical maturity well above average for the age of the band members, none of whom are out of high school.\n\nDrouz Started as \"Overruled\" with Abe, Peter and Stephen in the fall of 2003. They started covering artists such as Bob Dylan, Goldfinger, and Reliant K. Singer Dave Rydberg of Saint Cloud joined the band as they started to compose their own music early in 2004. Drummer Matt Heggestuen also began to tentatively join at this time. Soon after Rydberg had composed \"Lullaby\" for Drouz, he left for college, leaving the band singerless. Enter Brendan Ellis in the spring of 2004, and Drouz was complete.\n\n\n\nMembers:\n\nPeter Robbins [Bass, Keyboard, Guitar]\nAbe Gross [Lead Guitar]\nMatt Heggestuen [Drums]\nBrenden Ellis [Lead Vocals]\nMark Fjelstead [Rhythm Guitar] <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Drouz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
