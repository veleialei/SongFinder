The band got its name from a Robert Cray song of the same name. Originally a four piece, with Castle Rushen High School friends Jamie Armstrong (bass), Ross Doyle (drums) and Brian Garvey (rhythm guitar), the band was torn apart in 2004 when Brian was killed in a car accident along with their close friend Richie Brookes.\n\nDeciding to carry on in Brian's memory, Davy, Jamie and Ross reformed the band, with Davy writing the emotional tribute to his friend & former bandmate, 'Stay', which was later to appear on a rare EP and on their debut album 'Roll Away'. The trio recorded two EPs togethers, and played hundreds of gigs on their native Isle of Man before moving to London to live with Davy's manager, Bob Miller (Corinne Bailey Rae, Christine Collister). After a handful of gigs in the UK, Jamie decided to pursue a career in music production and left the band to go to University.\n\nIn 2007, with a spot secured at the SXSW Festival in Texas, Davy and Ross recruited former schoolmate Adam Jones to replace Jamie on bass. Adam joined Back Door Slam for what turned out to be two extensive tours of the US lasting until January 2009.\n\nOn January 27th, 2009, a letter was posted on Back Door Slam's website www.davyknowles.com , announcing that the band had 'broken up' and its members were pursuing different musical endeavors. The text of the letter is as follows:\n\n\"Dear Friends and Back Door Slam Family:\n\nAfter much thought and soul searching, we have reached the painful decision that we should part ways at this time. The decision was the hardest of our lives, but it's one we believe had to be made in order for each of us to move forward creatively and musically.\n\nWe will each continue with our own musical projects and hope to fulfill our own musical ambitions; Davy will be working on a follow up to the the first Back Door Slam album \"Roll Away\", and will be touring the US to support and promote the record, and Ross and Adam will be embarking on new projects of their own in the UK and Europe, so please keep checking backdoorslam.com for news about each member of the band, and upcoming album releases.\n\nWe'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has followed Back Door Slam over the last few years and shown their support for the three of us. Davy, Adam and Ross\"\n\nKnowles joined Jeff Beck as solo opening act for dates of his US Tour early 2009. He then recorded a new album, Coming Up For Air, with Peter Frampton as co-Producer, (and also adding guitar, backing vocals & co-writing two songs), along with Benmont Tench (keys), Mauricio Fritz Lewak (drums) and Kevin McCormick (bass), which was released in June 2009. He is now on the road as Davy Knowles and Back Door Slam, with PK (bass), Steven Barci (drums) and Ty Bailie (keys). \n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Back+Door+Slam\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
