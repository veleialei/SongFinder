Still without a drummer, the band held their first demonstration at Akasaka L@N on June 6 with their second demonstration at Urawa NARCISS on June 17.  Antic Cafe distributed 50 copies of their first demo, \"Ope●ng,\" in MiniDisc format at the second live.\n\nAt their debut live at Ikebukuro CYBER on July 2, the group sold their second demo MD \"Uzumaki Senshokutai / Hatsukoi.\"  The two demos were self-released and their last releases without a label.
