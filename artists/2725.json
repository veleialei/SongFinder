Gaining clout as an \"amazing\" (Red Gorilla Music Fest) and \"fresh\" (Crossroads Music Fest) live act, Pictures of Then takes to the stage with an energy that is undeniable. \"Spirited and buzzy...they swung with glam-pop abandon, channeling psychedelic folk-roots through howling indie-rock branches.\" (Mid-Point Music Festival) \"On stage they are dramatic without being pretentious, having a polished and confident stage presence.\" (howwastheshow.com) This comes as no surprise since the band is continually touring, attracting an ever-growing fan base on the festival circuit and at concert venues and college campuses nationwide. \n\nTheir debut album Crushed By Lights was touted as \"a sonic balance between reverence for the past and vision of the future,\" and helped the band secure a foothold on the national scene with featured accolades on MTV and college radio. Building on the success of their debut, the second album, And The Wicked Sea, “takes the aspects that made their music catch on from their debut album and expands on them, making for a punchy, Britpop sound that keeps you bouncing along.” (Guest List Magazine)  Said to have a \"Flaming Lips meets Dr. Dog vibe,\" (Comfort Comes) their sophomore effort “rings out loud and proud with a host of songs filled with Midwestern charm at its finest. The record evokes a sound that calls to mind Summerteeth-era Wilco, or possibly what Modest Mouse might have sounded like had Isaac Brock been born in Minneapolis himself. And The Wicked Sea is equal parts heart-lifting balladry and upbeat indie-rock, all designed to encourage the listener to eat, drink, and make merry along with the band.”  (DryvetymeOnlyne)\nIt is only a matter of time before this band, firmly rooted in indie soil, becomes one of the few independents to branch out into mainstream success because Pictures of Then “does their thing and they do it well.” (Guest List Magazine)\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pictures+of+Then\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
