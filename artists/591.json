This album was a spoken word recording of his infamous pre-fight poetry, most of which was written to promote his fight with, and intimidate, former opponent and (at the time) world champion Sonny Liston (who is mentioned by name several times during the recording). Recorded in front of an audience with a backing band and an additional vocal cast, the album also included a radio play - which featured Clay as a heroic dragon-slayer - and two single songs with Ali on vocals, including a cover of Stand By Me. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cassius+Clay\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
