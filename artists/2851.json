The group's members are: Larry Stewart, John Dittrich, Dave Innis, Paul Gregg and Greg Jennings. The members have diverse musical backgrounds, and developed a sound that has been compared to The Eagles. Primarily a country band, they crossed over to Adult Contemporary with singles from their Wheels and Big Iron Horses albums, and enjoyed their biggest crossover hit with \"When She Cries\" during late 1992.\n\nLarry Stewart left Restless Heart in late 1991 after the group released the compilation \"The Best of Restless Heart.\" The group then became a quartet and released \"Big Iron Horses\" in 1992 shortly after which Dave Innis left the group. The group released \"Matters of the Heart\" in 1994 before splitting up. In 1998, a reunited Restless Heart (minus Innis) recorded three new songs for a Greatest Hits album and then toured with Vince Gill for about a year.\n\nIn 2003, all five members reunited and recorded the album \"Still Restless\" for Koch Nashville in 2004. The record label closed in early 2005 leaving the group without a label. They are still touring and released a live album through their website in August 2007. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Restless+Heart\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
