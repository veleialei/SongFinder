Lily was a regular fixture inside the Park Street Subway Station, performing to ever increasing enthusiastic crowds of commuters.\n \n     With the 2008 release of her new album, \"Wicked Ways,\" an opening performance for Brian Wilson and a slot at New Jersey's \"All Points West\" festival headlined by Radiohead, Lily is no longer an underground sensation. Her music has caused pedestrian traffic jams in Boston's Harvard Square and Newbury Street, Santa Monica's famed Third Street Promenade and, more recently, in San Francisco's Castro area.\n \n      Lily first unleashed her voice on a wider audience with her independent debut \"Running from the Sky\" in 2000. Described by fans as \"a somber fairy tale\" the ethereal vocals and dark lyrics quickly earned a cult following resulting in the street singer selling over 20,000 copies as an unsigned artist. With her steady street buzz she was a natural choice for the film, \"Playing for Change\"-a rocumentary highlighting the lives of 16 street musicians across the country. The film struck a chord with audiences and was added into rotation on the Sundance Channel, the Independent Film Channel and Comcast On Demand. It also secured Lily her first record deal and in 2005 BackPorch/Virgin released her second album \"Everything Was Beautiful and Hurt.\"\n \n     Describing her music as melancholic rock, Lily's influences have always been diverse, ranging from Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd to Tori Amos, PJ Harvey and The Cure. Of her latest album the artist says \"This is my most accomplished work and fully represents who I am as an artist.\" As legendary producer Glen Ballard (Alanis Morisette, No Doubt, Michael Jackson) says: \"Lily Holbrook is the real deal!\"\n \n \n     Lily now calls San Francisco her home and has begun working on her fourth album. Her passion for causes such as LGBTQI rights, animal welfare, at risk youth and women's issues has her donating her musical talents to various charitable organizations throughout the bay area. She continues to busk and delight fans, locals and tourists with her impromtu concerts. \n \n  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lily+Holbrook\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
