She graduated from Belmont University with a degree in Music Education, but her life took an unexpected turn as she found that most schools were skeptical to hire a blind music teacher.  She began focusing on singing and songwriting, composing several songs and eventually capturing the interest of Michael W. Smith, who signed her to his label, Rocketown Records, in 1999.  Since then, Owens has released several albums, and her songs have been featured on television shows such as Roswell and Felicity.  Primarily backed by her own smooth and heartfelt piano playing, her music (along with her story) remains an inspiration to this day. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ginny+Owens\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
