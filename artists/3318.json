Taylor, was their only hit.\n\nOriginally ‘The Creators’, the group formed in 1964 in Bayonne with Hugh Harris, Danny Austin, Dave Watt, Norman Donegan and Mary Ann Thomas. \"The Boy From New York City\" was released in December 1964 and by March 1965 had reached number 8 on the US pop charts. The group followed this up with \"He Ain't No Angel\" which barely troubled the top 100. The next two singles failed to chart, and the Ad Libs were soon dropped from Red Bird Records. They continued to record into the 1980s, but have never repeated the success of \"The Boy From New York City\". The song went on to chart again in the UK for Darts in 1978 and in the US for The Manhattan Transfer in 1981). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Ad+Libs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
