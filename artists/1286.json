The band is best remembered for their 1970 signature song \"All Right Now\". Rolling Stone magazine referred to the band as \"British hard rock pioneers\" and has lead singer Paul Rodgers ranked as #55 in its list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\", while guitarist Paul Kossoff was ranked #51 in its list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". The band broke up in 1973, with singer Rodgers going on to become a frontman of Bad Company (along with rummer Simon Kirke), while guitarist Kossoff formed Back Street Crawler and died from a drug-induced heart failure at the age of 25 in 1976. Bassist Andy Fraser helped form Sharks.\nThe band was famed for its sensational live shows and nonstop touring. Early studio albums, however, did not sell very well â€“ until the release of Fire and Water which featured the massive hit \"All Right Now\". The song helped secure them a place at the huge Isle of Wight Festival 1970 where they played to 600,000 people.\nBy the early 1970s, Free was one of the biggest-selling British blues-rock groups; by the time the band dissolved in 1973, they had sold more than 20 million albums around the world and had played more than 700 arena and festival concerts. \"All Right Now,\" remains a rock staple, and had been entered into ASCAP's \"One Million\" airplay singles club.\nTheir debut album Tons of Sobs released in March 1969 had their own original blues songs. Their next self-titled album Free released in October 1969 was produced by Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records. Their musicianship had noticeably advanced, particularly Paul Rodgers vocals. \nThese two albums sold slowly until the release of  Fire and Water in June 1970. The album Fire and Water reached  number 2 in the U.K and number 17 in the U.S charts. It contains their biggest hit and most popular song All Right Now and reached number 2 in the U.K single chart and number 4 in the U.S Billboard chart.\nThis song helped secure them a place at the huge Isle of Wight Festival in August 1970 where they played to 600,000 people. \nTheir next album Highway was released in December 1970, but did not sell as well.\nFrustrated by Highway's commercial rejection and unsure of their future musical direction, Free was consumed by internal friction and a nagging sense of self-doubt, Free decided to break up in May 1971.\nThe album Free Live! was released September 1971. This live album was recorded in Sunderland and Croydon in the U.K, places where the band had a strong following, during January and September 1970.\nHaving struggled in their own new projects, Free decided to set aside their differences and reformed in January 1972.\nFree released two more studio albums, Free at Last in June 1972 and Heartbreaker in January 1973.\nWhile Free at Last and its accompanying single \"Little Bit of Love\" re-established the band commercially, a crippling mixture of old and new problems surfaced, again threatening the future of the group. The most serious of which was Paul Kossoff's mounting drug addiction which led to his ill-health and not being able to play at gigs on a U.S tour.\nFree decided to break up for good in July 1973.\nPaul Rodgers went on to become lead singer of the rock band Bad Company along with Simon Kirke on drums. Paul Kossoff, the hugely talented and much-revered lead guitarist (son of British religious broadcaster David Kossoff), died tragically from drug-induced heart failure on the 19th March 1976, aged 25. Rolling Stone magazine later honored Kossoff as one of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists\" by David Fricke.\nThe core members of the band were:\nPaul Rodgers - lead vocals\nPaul Kossoff - lead guitar\nAndy Fraser - bass guitar, piano\nSimon Kirke - drums\nFree official website:  http://www.freetheband.co.uk/\n\n2) Free is a trance act who recorded in 2010\t\t\t\n\n3) Free is an artist who performs with Taz\n\n4) Free is female rapper (and former presenter of \"106 and park\"), born Antoinette Marie Wright on February 7, 1968.\n\n5) Free is a US techno remixer <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Free\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
