First album was recorded prior to her 15th birthday.   \nOnce she understood that she is missing something, she started studying seriously and did so for 6 consecutive years in which she conquered vocal, classic music, theater, and opera. \nAfter her studies, along with working as a host and creator of music television programs in the Ukrainian television at Kiev and as a model, she got heavily involved in music. Elvira experimented and recorded in a variety of musical combinations and styles: being involved in contemporary pop music, personal mixed-style exhibited in her album \"INSIDE\" (lots of drums with opera voice), and as a lead singer in the \"FUSION ORCHESTRA\". \nHer album \"PEACHY PINK\" is a mixture of \"gentle rock\", \"electronic pop\", \"jungle music\" and jazz and other styles. The musical ideas were inspired by the lyrics of Edo Kaluski, and supported by many talented musicians.\nCurrently, Elvira is working on a new electronic project, which will come out soon.  \nwww.elvirak.com  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Elvira\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
