In the 1970's he often posed as a machoman, the \"Tom Jones of Finland\".\nIn this decade he hasn't got big hits anymore, but he records new songs constantly. Many of them are covers like Kumimies (Dragostea din tei) or Seksipommi (Sexbomb). His previous hits are also mostly covers - three big hits are from repertoire of German Dschinghis Khan group. He has also made cover songs of Village People and so on.\nOne of the biggest hits is anyway Titanic from the Finnish National Final for Eurovision Song Contest 1981.\nFrederik keeps his own style even though the world changes around.
