Skeletonwitch's song \"Soul Thrashing Black Sorcery\" was featured on the soundtrack of the video game Brütal Legend. The song \"Crushed Beyond Dust\" became featured on the Rock Band network on February 28, 2010. Skeletonwitch was featured on all of the dates of Ozzfest 2010.\n\nSkeletonwitch was featured on an Adult Swim video for their song \"Bringers of Death\" in 2010. \"Bringers of Death\" also appears on the Adult Swim heavy metal compilation titled Metal Swim.\n\nIn March 2011, Skeletonwitch parted ways with drummer Derrick \"Mullet Chad\" Nau and temporarily replaced him with Tony Laureano. Skeletonwitch's fourth studio album, Forever Abomination, was released on October 7, 2011. It is the first album to feature Dustin Boltjes on drums, replacing Derrick Nau.\n\nAdam Clemans – lead vocals\nNate Garnette – guitars\nScott Hedrick – guitars\nEvan Linger – bass\nDustin Boltjes - drums <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Skeletonwitch\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
