He is the same Vaughan Mason who produced the hit \"Bounce, Rock, Skate, Roll\" for Brunswick Records in 1979. The group also contained vocalist Keith Thompson. They hit number one on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart in 1988 with \"Break 4 Love\". The song also crossover to Urban radio stations where it became a moderate hit and remains a favourite on the Urban radio format to this day. \"Break 4 Love\" hit number one on the dance chart again in 2001 when it was covered by Peter Rauhofer and the Pet Shop Boys under the name The Collaboration.\nIn October 2004 \"Break 4 Love\" appeared in popular videogame Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, playing on house music radio station SF-UR.\n\nRaze (Christian pop group)  was a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Christian pop group formed by vocalists Donnie Lewis, Ja'Marc Davis, J.D. Webb,  and Mizzie Logan . They are perhaps best known for their song \"Always and Forever\" , found on their premier album Power. On the groups 2000 release \"The Plan\" J.D. Webb was replaced with Todd Hanebrink.\nSadly the band formally disbanded on November 12, 2001.\n\nRaze (Hip-Hop artist): From Tony Touch mixtapes to Unsigned Hype columns to Fight Klub titles, New York City's Raze has been through it all. After a failed label situation with Loud as a member of Ghetto Inmates, Raze has re-immerged on the scene with an onslaught of heat. Garnering the attention of Heavyweights in the game like DJ Muggs, The Beatnuts and The Alchemist, and touring with M1 from Dead Prez and Talib Kweli, it's only a matter of time before Raze is a household name. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Raze\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
