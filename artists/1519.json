In the 1990s they experienced success around Spain and the Americas, and various European countries including Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, France and Portugal becoming a successful Spanish group and icons in the history of the Rock en Español scene. After ten years and numerous albums, the band broke up in 1997. Then later on, the artist Enrique Bunbury went solo. In 2007, as part of a 20 year anniversary celebration and 11 years after their break-up, they participated in a 10 concert world tour.\n\nHeroes del Silencio started in 1984 as a band named Zumo de Vidrio. The original members were Enrique Bunbury, Juan Valdivia and his brother, and Pedro Andreu. Bunbury was originally a bass player but after Juan Valdivia heard him singing a David Bowie song and told him that he had a great voice, Bunbury became the vocalist. Later on, Joaquin Cardiel joins the line-up.\n\nThe band changed their name to Heroes del Silencio in 1986. At first they played in public places and made demos but their break came when they participated in a music contest in Salamanca and won second place - an EMI producer, Gustavo Montesano, saw the band in the contest and some time later, at a concert in Sala En Bruto, he signed the band.\n\nTheir first EP, Héroe de Leyenda, was released in in 1987 and sold 30,000 copies. The following year, the album El Mar No Cesa was released, featuring the songs \"Mar Adentro\", \"Agosto\" and \"El Estanque\", and sold 100,000 copies. The supporting tour followed in 1989, documented on the limited edition live album En Directo.\n\nIn 1990 they released Senderos de Traicion, their best-selling album with 2 million copies, including 400,000 copies in the first two weeks in Spain alone. The following year they started the tour \"Senda 91\" and released another live album, Senda 91. 1992 saw the most important CD in their career, El Espiritu del Vino. They sold 600,000 copies of this album which was played throughout America. They followed this with a tour for El Espiritu del Vino. In 1993, Alan Bogulavsky joined the band.\n\nDue to tensions within the band, they took a hiatus and went to Benasque to take a vacation and heal the rifts within the group. After this break they gained a new producer, Bob Ezrin (Lou Reed, Pink Floyd, Peter Gabriel, Alice Cooper, Kiss, etc.) and in 1995 released Avalancha, widely considered their best album. Avalancha was more hard rock than previous albums, with songs like \"Avalancha\", \"Deshacer El Mundo\" and \"Iberia Sumergida\". The album was followed by the \"Avalancha\" tour in 1995 and 1996, which produced the live album Para Siempre.\n\nThe band split in 1996 though this did not prevent the release of the Rarezas album in 1998.\n\n2007 Reunion tour\n 20 years after their first album, and 10 years after they split up, the band announced a ten concerts reunion tour, taking in Guatemala City, Buenos Aires, Monterrey, Ciudad de México, Los Ángeles, Sevilla, Zaragoza and Valencia. For this tour, guitarist Gonzalo Valdivia (Juan Valdivia's brother) replaced former band member Alan Bogulavsky. More than 10,000 people attended each concert. The tour was followed by another live album, Tour 2007.\nAfter the tour, singer-songwriter Enrique Bunbury announced the definitive split of the band and that he would be focusing in his solo career. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/H%C3%A9roes+del+Silencio\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
