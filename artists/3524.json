In 1976 singer Robert Lloyd, with guitarist/drummer brothers Alan and Paul Apperley formed after an advert was placed in the Birmingham Evening Mail. They were Birmingham's first punk group. The band were part of The Clash's 'White Riot Tour', toured with Subway Sect, Buzzcocks, played with The Slits, The Jam, The Fall, The Damned, The Skids and many others, before recording two sessions for the John Peel radio show. The band acquired legendary status in the UK, partly because no records were released until the band had split up, and then, only one posthumous single on Rough Trade. However, in November 2004 a retrospective compilation \"Amateur Wankers\" was released by NYC record label Acute Records which, twenty five years after the group's demise, garnered praise all over, from webzines to Rolling Stone. The interest was such that now a 'Live in 1978' CD was also released on British label Caroline True in 2005. They are best remembered for their seven-second opus \"I've Got V.D.\". The Prefects' final line up transformed into The Nightingales. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Prefects\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
