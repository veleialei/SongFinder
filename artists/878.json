It wasn’t long before these songs ended up in the hands of the CEO of Astonish Records, and soon David found himself in the studio, turning those ten love songs into his debut record, Something in Your Eyes. For the album, David worked with the legendary Manu Katché (drummer for Sting and Peter Gabriel) and mixer Jeff Juliano, who has worked with John Mayer, the Dave Matthews Band, and Jason Mraz.  \n\nSince the album’s release, David’s career continues to gain momentum: he opened for Elton John and has won the heart of Billboard magazine. He has been featured on Amazon.com’s “Breakthrough Artist Program” and his music video for “Something in Your Eyes” was directed by Oscar nominee Bobby Garabedian. On Valentine’s Day, David was featured on the front page of The Wall Street Journal and he has been featured in Billboard magazine several times. “Star quality abounds,” the magazine says, and, as quoted by the Wall Street Journal, David is the “voice of romance.” \n\n“I like to encourage people that there really is a happily ever after,” David says. “And I’ve done my best to be honest about love through my music. The deepest love I’ve experienced is on the other side of forgiveness. For me, true love is worth whatever it costs. I hope my songs spark a greater love for others.”\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Martin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
