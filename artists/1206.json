Her first release was Morris's song \"Shake a Hand\", which topped the U.S. R&B chart for ten weeks in 1953 and made number 22 on the U.S. pop chart.\n\nIn 1954, Faye had two more R&B chart toppers with \"I'll Be True\" (covered by Bill Haley) and \"It Hurts Me to My Heart\". During this period, she left the Morris band and was billed as \"Atomic Adams\". In 1955 she appeared in the film Rhythm & Blues Revue, and in 1957 moved to Imperial Records, but her commercial success diminished. By the late 1950s she was seen as an older recording artist whose time had come and gone, although she continued to record for various smaller labels until the early 1960s.\n\nBy 1963 she had retired from the music industry. She returned to her gospel roots and family life in New Jersey. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Faye+Adams\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
