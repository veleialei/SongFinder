He worked with the group on their first album and then left the group to pursue his own solo career. He was signed to DreamWorks Records and began working on an album.\n\nIn 1999, Hollister released his first albumm, Ghetto Hymns. The album was successful, going gold, and creating one hit single, \"My Favorite Girl.\" \"My Favorite Girl\" reached #10 on the R&B charts.\n\nHollister's follow-up album, Chicago '85... The Movie was released in 2000. The album was an autobiographical work and went gold. \"One Woman Man\" the album's biggest single, reached #8 on the R&B charts.\n\nFor his third effort, Hollister moved to Motown Records. He hoped the new label would instill new energy into his music. The album, Things In the Game Done Changed was released in 2002 and faired poorly on the charts and radio.\n\nAs a result of the album's shortcomings, Hollister returned to DreamWorks where he released Real Talk in 2003. Following the album's release, Hollister moved to Gospo Centric.\n\nHollister is reportedly wrapping up his fifth album in the industry, The Book of David: Vol. 1 The Transition. The album will be coming out on September 26, 2006 from Gospo Centric.\n\nAlbums\n\n    * 1999: Ghetto Hymns (DreamWorks)\n    * 2000: Chicago '85...The Movie (DreamWorks)\n    * 2002: Things in the Game Done Changed (Motown)\n    * 2003: Real Talk (DreamWorks)\n    * 2006: The Book of David: Vol.1 The Transition (Gospo Centric)\n\n\n    * 2006: The Definitive Collection (Hip-O)\n\nMore information can be found at \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Hollister\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Hollister\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
