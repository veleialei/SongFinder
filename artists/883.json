He is perhaps best remembered for the haunting theme to the 1944 movie Laura. Johnny Mercer put lyrics to this theme, and during Raksin's lifetime this was said to be the second most-recorded song in history following only Stardust by Hoagy Carmichael and Mitchell Parish.\n\nRaksin also taught courses at the University of Southern California and the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nHis son Alex is a Pulitzer Prize winning editorial writer for the Los Angeles Times.\n\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Raksin) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Raksin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
