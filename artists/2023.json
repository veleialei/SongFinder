Bid, in which Van Dyke played himself as an auctioneer.\n\nHis next hit song, \"Walk on By\", reached number one on the Billboard Country Music Chart in 1961, and remained on the charts for 37 weeks. In 1994 Billboard Magazine designated \"Walk on By\" as the No.1 country song in chart history. Van Dyke had one more major hit song, \"If a Woman Answers (Hang up the Phone)\", that reached No.3 on the country chart in 1962, as well as having a brief presence in the UK Singles Chart the same year with \"Big Man in a Big House\".\n\nVan Dyke's final two minor country successes were \"Happy To Be Unhappy\" and \"Night People\" (both in 1964). He also co-hosted a radio show called Country Crossroads with Bill Mack and Jerry Clower for a number of years. This show was produced and distributed by the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\nLeroy Van Dyke continues as an auctioneer, musician and motivational speaker, although he has largely retired to his home state. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Leroy+Van+Dyke\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
