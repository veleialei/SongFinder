He has also embarked on a successful solo career, producing tunes such as 1978's rambunctious hit \"New York Groove\".\n\nHis arena rock and glam metal styled work includes playing in Frehley's Comet. His solo efforts were put on hold when he rejoined Kiss in 1996 for a highly successful reunion tour. His second tenure with Kiss lasted until 2002, when he left at the conclusion of the band's Farewell Tour. He has since resumed his solo career, and he's currently touring the U.S. with his latest album being 2014's 'Space Invader'. He has also written the acclaimed memoir 'No Regrets', which details his working-class background and past hard-partying lifestyle.\n\nWebsite: http://www.acefrehley.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ace+Frehley\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
