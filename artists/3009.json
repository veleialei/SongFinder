They made the bet and they went in a search for new sounds coming from spanish folk and pop culture to combine with their powerful rock style. \nThe result has been generational hymns in Spain as \"Chiquilla\" or \"Tenochtitlan\".\n\nAfter some time not hearing anything from Seguridad Social , they were back with a great version of \"Salta!\" in a tribute album to Tequila. In 1998 they released an album recorded in Los Angeles \"En la boca del volcan\". You can emphasize  Aris (Aristides Abreu) at the guitar,  a new addition to the band, which improved its already great sound.\n\nTheir range of styles opened up; from Ska to Salsa, Soul, Andean music and even dared to use new instruments, but their spirit of trully rockers was as strong as usual and didn't lose its Latin fury.\n\nIn 2002 they celebrated their 20th anniversary with the release of Greatest Hits \"Gracias por las molestias. Two new tracks and a DVD with video clips and live shots is what was added to their new job which compiles all the successes of the band from Valencia. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Seguridad+Social\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
