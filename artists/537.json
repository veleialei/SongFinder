Gonzalez first noticed Ferreter's unique vocal range with her work in her previous group, Language of Love, an Art-pop group led by Ecstatic Sunshine guitarist Matt Papich. Soon the two added long time mutual friend Jared Paolini on Bass and Guitar. Adapting their early work to fit Paolini proved difficult and the band experienced some growing pains. After some restructuring, the groupsolidified into their current incarnation. Taking cues from producers such as Phil Spector and Joe Meek, the group updates the sound of French yé yé chanteuses like France Gall and Chantal Goya with hints of Lounge, 60s Garage, and Pop Psychedelia. In their approach, they share a similar lineage to late seventies early eighties No Wave groups such as Family Fodder, or The Honeymoon Killers (les tueurs de la lune de miel).\n\nSome influences include Brigitte Fontaine, Serge Gainsbourg, Dominique A, France Gall, The Rolling Stones, Nico and The Velvet Underground, Syd Barrett, Chet Baker, Jacques Prévert. Chantal Goya, Os Mutantes,The Shangri-las, The Idle Race, The United States of America, Neon Pearl, The Zombies, \nBill Plummer & The Cosmic Brotherhood, and Question Mark & The Mysterians\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cache+Cache\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
