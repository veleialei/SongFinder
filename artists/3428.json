The band have built a sizable following with headline slots at Camden Underworld, The Spitz, and countless venues across the country. Support slots include The Damned, The Gathering, Clan of Xymox and labelmates Inkubus Sukkubus. \"Dread the Day\" and \"To the Gods that Walk Amongst Us\" proved to be huge dancefloor hits in Germany which led to successful European live dates. The Lemora shows are both extravagant yet typically homely and recently resulted in a nomination for 2008 The Indie Music Awards. \n\nThey are on constant rotation on Sky music channel Rockworld TV and have had various appearances including Radio 1 and Totalrock Radio. \n\nLemora have received rave reviews and featured in some of the scenes leading magazines, both home and abroad. \n\nTracks from their EP and debut album have appeared on several compilations worldwide. Most recently \"Kissing the Plague\" features on the movie soundtrack to \"Vampire Diaries\". \n\n2007 saw the release of their eagerly awaited second album. Produced by Reza Udhin of the legendary Killing Joke, Lemora have surpassed their outstanding debut with \"Happy End of the World\". \n\nEclectic influences ranging from Sparks to The Stranglers via Scott Walker and Queens of the Stone Age have created a unique album of 14 classic tracks. \n\nBack on the road at the end of 2008 after a slight sabbatical to train a new bass player, Lemora are now looking forward to a bright 2009 with new tracks, gigs including London and Paris and many more of their famously frivolous antics. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Ghost+of+Lemora\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
