This album includes two versions, a folk/rock mix and an acoustic guitar bonus mix. Available at CD Baby, Amazon.com, and iTunes.   \n\nHailed as \"a miraculous breakthrough into a feeling world\" by British music critic Ian MacDonald, the songs on WATER FALLS DOWN explore love, loss, living. Robin's vocal style blends the intimacy of Norah Jones and the silkiness of Enya with the classic, laid-back phrasing of Dusty Springfield. The Electro-Acoustic backing tracks create a downtempo atmosphere shaded with Dance, Jazz/Pop, and World Beat. \n\nRobin is a master of her craft, a songwriter, poet, and storyteller with a unique and compelling vision. John Braheny, author of The Craft and Business of Songwriting, says: \"I love it! Musically mystical and evocative with enough body grounding groove to balance it. Lyrically cliche-free with some profound observations.\" Visit the world of muses and lovers, the lost, the betrayed, the dreamers and visionaries who live and love in these songs. Let the music take you to their world, the place where water falls down.   \n\nMakeaStar.com ~ \"... wonderfully moody and atmospheric.\"  \n\nARTIST HISTORY: Robin has written and produced over 500 songs for television and record albums. She currently writes and teaches songwriting in Los Angeles, California. Visit Robin Frederick's web site for bio, articles, and news.   www.robinfrederick.com.\n\nStephanie Bennett, Harpworld Music Co. ~ \"Robin Frederick's WATER FALLS DOWN is an intoxicating work, a standout achievement in contemporary songwriting and production. The lyrics are haunting and intriguing poetry; the music is engaging with a Sting-like sophistication; Robin's voice is beautifully gentle and mysterious, a fitting counterpoint to the energy of the songs. The production values are nothing short of gorgeous. \" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Robin+Frederick\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
