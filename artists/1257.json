(Last year He even performed in front of the Vice President of the United States broadcast on C-SPAN).\n\nKnown for \"dead on\" impressions of famous actors (like Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Robert DeNiro), politicians (George W. Bush, Bill Clinton) and broadcasters (John Madden, David Letterman, Jay Leno, and Jim Rome), Frank, a 7 year veteran of television sketch comedy (MadTV, Hype) will begin his own show later this year (First airing the Tuesday before thanks giving). \"Frank TV\" is set to debut late fall on the TBS network.\n\nOn the Stage, Frank's high energy act is a blend of observations, impressions, characters and anecdotal stories that build to a frenetic pace. Once described by the \"Hollywood Reporter\" as \"a combination of Robin Williams and Jim Carrey\" Frank is one comedian that should not be missed.\n\nOther places you might have seen Frank: \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\", \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\", \"Conan O'Brien\", \"The View\", \"Last Call with Carson Daly\", Superbowl XXXIX, \"Comedy Central Presents Frank Caliendo\", \"The Best Damn Sports show Period\", and \"Mike and Mike\" on ESPN 2.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Caliendo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
