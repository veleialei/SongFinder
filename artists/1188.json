She soon gained a \ncult following in the university and pub circuit \nin Taiwan while touring with her backing \nband - Monster.\n\nIn 1996 she signed with Magicstone records. \nHer first two albums are heavily influenced by the\nAustralian pub rock style, with a gothic \nundertone noticeable in tracks such as \"Silence\", \n\"Fear\" and \"Monster\", while her third album has a \nlighter pop style, with only hints of the anger \nevident in the first two recordings. All three \nalbums were huge hits in Taiwan and in 2000 Faith \nwon the Taiwan Golden Music awards for Best Female\nPerformer and Best Album.\n\nFaith did not renew her contract with Magicstone,\nclaiming the label had become too commercial for her\nstyle of music. In 2004 it was reported that she had\nsigned with Sony label Silver Fish Records, but no new\nalbums have been produced so far.\n\nFaith also works as a fashion and cosmetics model for\ncompanies such as Rado and Neutrogena, as well as\ncontinuing to tour on the Taiwan pub circuit. She has\nalso considered a number of acting roles. In 2000 Faith\nplayed a lead part in the web movie \"175 Degrees of\nColour Blindness\", a 20 part flash movie made\nespecially for release on the internet.\n\nAlbums:\nYear - Company - Album Title\n1997 - Magicstone - One\n1999 - Magicstone - Silence\n2001 - Magicstone - Ought To\n2004 - Rock Records - First Selection\nDec 2006 - Asiamuse Entertainment - Duchess\n\nOther releases:\nYear - Company - Title\n1999 - Magicstone - Rest MV VCD\n2004 - Rock Records - Faith MV DVD\n1999 - Magicstone - Monster Live CD <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Faith+Yang\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
