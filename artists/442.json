Marchan also had a solo #1 hit on the national R&B charts in 1960 with the tune \"There is Something on your Mind\", a smaller previous hit for Big Jay McNeely.\nOther minor hits for Marchan included \"booty Green\" ( 1960), \"Quit My Job\" (1960), \"Things I Used To Do\" ( 1965), and \"Shake Your Tambourine\" (1966)\n\nHe continued to work the oldies circuit & perform in drag revues throughout the next couple decades.\n\nIn the 1990's he cut back on performances when he suffered illness, including kidney problems, but still managed to promote Hip Hop acts & was reportedly a key figure in the formation of Cash Money Records before dying at age 69.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+Marchan\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
