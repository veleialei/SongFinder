two album releases: 'In The Evening' and 'Not Enough Time' Most of the tracks on this site (mush) are by them, so they're ranked in the first position.\n\n2: MUSh: It would be simply said that the MUSh are four friends of old date that are having a good time playing straightforward and happy songs.\n\nThe appearance deceives: everything is not so easy... \n\nThese four young boys have met at the times of the elementary school. Since 1997 they try to use all their free-time for playing their own music; that communicates positive and joy; that amuses the public that asks more and more easygoing music.\nThey compose original songs which are \"simple and melodic\" for entertaining with an acoustic and refined music the evenings of whom is around them.\n\nWith by now a good “live” experience matured during the many evenings in Switzerland and with a self-made album in 2000, the MUSh in 2004 present themselves to the great public with their first official album TWENTY. \nThis is an album that contains all the particularities of the MUSh: fun, methodology, simplicity, thoughtlessness, taste for the arrangements and desire to transmit emotions.\n\nMUSh, Lugano, Switzerland\n\nThe MUSh are: \n\nNicolas Küpfer - Vox and guitar \nStefano Tonella - Guitars \nFrancesco Polli – Drums, percussions and piano \nNiccolò Castelli – Bass guitar\nFederico Polli - Guitars\n\n3: Olivier Mutschler\nDJ, electronic music teacher, producer and sound designer from France, Olivier Mutschler has released tracks with Orlando Voorn, Kai Alcé, or Chez Damier, and has remixed Juan Atkins and Alton Miller, to name a few.\n\n4. MUSH is a unit of the formerly popular Japanese variety show 'Quiz! Hexagon II' which consists of comedian Shinagawa Hiroshi, singer/Sata Andagi member Matsuoka Takuya and comedian Mukai Satoshi. They released a song on the WE LOVE HEXAGON 2011 compilation album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mush\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
